"[D] Models that Rationalize Post-hoc (Idea) There is some evidence that humans make decisions first and then come up with rationalizations post-hoc (see The Righteous Mind). Many of our rationalizations are wrong, but we convince ourselves of their correctness and that gives us peace of mind.

Could we do the same thing to neural networks?

There’s a lot of really good research around explainability in neural networks. This research is well done and probably a better approach for the ultimate goal of understanding these kinds of models, but we’re going to throw it all out the window. Instead of making our model explainable, we’re going to do what humans do and try to come up with reasonable post-hoc rationalizations.

Here’s the idea. 

1. Take a trained model, any model works, but for now we’ll assume it is an image classifier.
2. Use it to classify a bunch of images.
3. Send those images to humans to label them with reasonable rationalizations. For instance if an image is labeled “dog” instruct the humans to respond: “Because I see pointy ears, a tail, and a furry belly.” This may be hard depending on the domain, because humans are admittedly also bad at this task.
4. Build a GAN that given an image gives you a rationalization. Due to the adversarial nature of GANs, the model will be incentivized to give reasons that are verifiable in the image.

Boom. Congratulations, you now have a model that you still don’t understand how it works but it may convince you that it understands itself.

Additional notes:

* Negative rationalizations could be useful as well. For instance you could ask: “Why isn’t a mouse?” And the response could be something like: “It is too big to be a mouse.”
* Using BERT or another recent LM as a basis for the GAN will ultimately make the rationalizations seem more reasonable and diverse.
* You could even train on hard or wrong samples. Post-hoc rationalization doesn’t require the original model to be correct as long as labelers can create a reasonable rationalization for the poor choice.",data science

"[NO SPOILERS] How can writers that aren't very good like D&D rise to the top of Hollywood? If you look at thier past there's nothing special. It's pretty evident that neither of them are good writers, in fact right after they were done with GOT HBO rejected thier own original show that was about an alternate reality where the confederacy won the US civil war (wow so interesting).

Now, that's all good and fine, but what I don't understand is 2 things.

1. Since they're both mediocre at best how do they rise in a position to head GOT for HBO?
2. And secondly, why on Earth would they get exrtemely expensive deals/offers from Disney to make a Star Wars trilogy (which is not happening anymore) and an offer from Netflix, of which the only thing they've produced so far was 1 comedy special and I believe they're adapting another book series for Netflix now.

"Service provider vs network domain dimension Hey /r/Analytics,

I was checking what sort of companies were browsing my website through the service provider dimension. Which is fun. But there is another seemingly relevant dimension which confuses me when used in conjunction with the service provider dimension (and vice versa).

* Network domain: The fully qualified domain names of your visitors' Internet service providers (ISPs). 
* Service provider: The names of the Internet service providers (ISPs) used by visitors to your site.

These short summaries don't make the distinction clear to me. After checking some competitors both ways through these dimensions the network domain can help filter traffic through ISPs, but the other way around doesn't work AT ALL. 

Example: One of our competitors i found through the service provider dimension lists the domain of one of the biggest national network providers as their network domain. How does that make any sense? It seems like the two dimensions are swapped around.... 

Can someone explain this to me? I'd like to keep tabs on competitors browsing my website, but this doesn't make much sense to me. 

Thanks in advance!

Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

A good image-to-image translation model should learn a mapping between different visual domains while satisfying the following properties: 1) diversity of generated images and 2) scalability over multiple domains. Existing methods address either of the issues, having limited diversity or multiple models for all domains. We propose StarGAN v2, a single framework that tackles both and shows significantly improved results over the baselines. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and a new animal faces dataset (AFHQ) validate our superiority in terms of visual quality, diversity, and scalability. To better assess image-to-image translation models, we release AFHQ, high-quality animal faces with large inter- and intra-domain variations. The code, pretrained models, and dataset will be released for reproducibility.",data science

&amp;#x200B;

\-Simple exponential smoothing (Brown method): 

&amp;#x200B;

  
 I use Solver to optimize alpha (minimising RMSE) either using GRG-non linear solving method or evolutionary and it reurns optimal value a=0. (This happens  in many product cases - I have multiple worksheets: one for each product)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Holt's-Winters method:

&amp;#x200B;

I use Solver to optimize alpha,beta,gamma (minimising RMSE) and it returns some times a=0, b=0.45 (for example), gamma=1 or combinations where  α, β,or γ is zero or one , and the other one is a ''normal'' number. On other worksheets (products) the optimal values are okay.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody can help me with that? I know that α, β,γ  must be &gt;=0 and &lt;=1. But in practice, why sometimes the optimal values in my case are extreme values? Do the actual values (data for actual demand) play any role on that? Is there any way to fix it or should i keep it that way?

"Fairlearn - A Python package to assess AI system's fairness In 2015, Claire Cain Miller wrote on [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html) that there was a widespread belief that software and algorithms that rely on data were objective. Five years later, we know for sure that AI is not free of human influence. Data is created, stored, and processed by people, machine learning algorithms are written and maintained by people, and AI applications simply reflect people’s attitudes and behavior. 

Data scientists know that no longer accuracy is the only concern when developing machine learning models, fairness must be considered as well.

## 1. Fairlearn: a tool to assess AI system’s fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues

[Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) is a Python package that empowers developers of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assess their system’s fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues. [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) contains mitigation algorithms as well as a Jupyter widget for model assessment. The [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) package has two components:

* A *dashboard* for assessing which groups are negatively impacted by a model, and for comparing multiple models in terms of various fairness and accuracy metrics.
* *Algorithms* for mitigating unfairness in a variety of AI tasks and along a variety of fairness definitions.

There is also a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/master/notebooks?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) and an a detailed [API guide](https://fairlearn.github.io/api_reference/index.html?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri), that you can check to learn how to leverage [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) for your own data science scenario.

## 2. How to use Fairlearn in Azure Machine Learning

The [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) package can be installed via:

`pip install fairlearn` 

or optionally with a full feature set by adding extras, e.g. pip install fairlearn\[customplots\], or you can clone the repository locally via:

`git clone git@github.com:fairlearn/fairlearn.git` 

In Azure Machine Learning, there are a few options to use Jupyter notebooks for your experiments:

### a) Get Fairlearn samples on your notebook server

If you’d like to bring your own notebook server for local development, follow these steps:

1. Use the instructions at [**Azure Machine Learning SDK**](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) to install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python
2. Create an [**Azure Machine Learning workspace**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri).
3. Write a [**configuration file**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-environment#workspace?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) 
4. Clone [**the GitHub repository**](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri).

`git clone git@github.com:fairlearn/fairlearn.git` 

5. Start the notebook server from your cloned directory.

`jupyter notebook` 

For more information, see [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri).

b) Get Fairlearn samples on DSVM

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a customized VM image built specifically for doing data science. If you [create a DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-environment?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri#dsvm), the SDK and notebook server are installed and configured for you. However, you’ll still need to create a workspace and clone the sample repository.

1. [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri).
2. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri).

`git clone git@github.com:fairlearn/fairlearn.git`

3. Add a workspace configuration file to the cloned directory using either of these methods:

* In the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri), select Download config.json from the Overview section of your workspace.
* Create a new workspace using code in the [configuration.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/configuration.ipynb?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) notebook in your cloned directory

4. Start the notebook server from your cloned directory:

`jupyter notebook`

## 3. What we mean by fairness

Fighting against unfairness and discrimination has a long history in philosophy and psychology, and recently in machine learning. However, in order to be able to achieve fairness, we should first define the notion of it. An AI system can behave unfairly for a variety of reasons and many different fairness explanations have been used in literature, making this definition even more challenging. In general, fairness definitions fall under three different categories as follows:

* *Individual Fairness* – Give similar predictions to similar individuals. 
* *Group Fairness* – Treat different groups equally.
* *Subgroup Fairness* – Subgroup fairness intends to obtain the best properties of the group and individual notions of fairness. 

In [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri), we define whether an AI system is behaving unfairly in terms of its impact on people – i.e., in terms of harms. We focus on two kinds of harms:

* *Allocation harms*. These harms can occur when AI systems extend or withhold opportunities, resources, or information. Some of the key applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending.
* *Quality-of-service harms*. Quality of service refers to whether a system works as well for one person as it does for another, even if no opportunities, resources, or information are extended or withheld.

We follow the approach known as group fairness, which asks: Which groups of individuals are at risk of experiencing harm? The relevant groups need to be specified by the data scientist and are application-specific. Group fairness is formalized by a set of constraints, which require that some aspect (or aspects) of the AI system’s behavior be comparable across the groups. The [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) package enables the assessment and mitigation of unfairness under several common definitions.

## 4. Fairlearn algorithms

[Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) contains the following algorithms for mitigating unfairness in binary classification and regression:

https://preview.redd.it/2inmvd6g75051.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3386410974a9e3640ef8ef8a409a2f19f989330a

## 5. Fairlearn dashboard

[Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn?WT.mc_id=build2020_ca-blogpost-lazzeri) dashboard is a Jupyter notebook widget for assessing how a model’s predictions impact different groups (e.g., different ethnicities), and also for comparing multiple models along different fairness and accuracy metrics.

To assess a single model’s fairness and accuracy, the dashboard widget can be launched within a Jupyter notebook as follows:

`from fairlearn.widget import FairlearnDashboard`

`# A_test containts your sensitive features (e.g., age, binary gender)` 

`# sensitive_feature_names containts your sensitive feature names` 

`# y_true contains ground truth labels` 

`# y_pred contains prediction labels` 

`FairlearnDashboard(sensitive_features=A_test,` 

`sensitive_feature_names=['BinaryGender', 'Age'],`  

`y_true=Y_test.tolist(),`  

`y_pred=[y_pred.tolist()])`

After the launch, the widget walks the user through the assessment set-up, where the user is asked to select:

1. the sensitive feature of interest (e.g., binary gender or age)
2. the accuracy metric (e.g., model precision) along which to evaluate the overall model performance as well as any disparities across groups. 

These selections are then used to obtain the visualization of the model’s impact on the subgroups (e.g., model precision for females and model precision for males). The following figures illustrate the set-up steps, where binary gender is selected as a sensitive feature and the accuracy rate is selected as the accuracy metric:

After the set-up, the dashboard presents the model assessment in two panels, as summarized in the table, and visualized in the screenshot below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/enskhh7i75051.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db98cb058029655757df1946e42bca4831170451

## 6. Comparing multiple models

An additional feature that this dashboard offers is the comparison of multiple models, such as the models produced by different learning algorithms and different mitigation approaches, including:

* `fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch`
* `fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient`
* `fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer`

As before, the user is first asked to select the sensitive feature and the accuracy metric. The model comparison view then depicts the accuracy and disparity of all the provided models in a scatter plot. This allows the user to examine trade-offs between algorithm accuracy and fairness. Moreover, each of the dots can be clicked to open the assessment of the corresponding model. 

The figure below shows the model comparison view with binary gender selected as a sensitive feature and accuracy rate selected as the accuracy metric.

"[SPOILERS] Season 1 Frustration First off I'll start by saying yes I know it's a show. But man season 1 is so frustrating. Honestly most of the bloodshed throughout the series could have just been avoided if Ned went along with Renly and Littlefinger. Renly said he could have gotten 100 men, whether that was his or his and Loris Tyrell's. Littlefinger could have delivered the Gold Cloaks and not betrayed Ned. Once they seized Joffery, Ned could have played along until Stannis arrived back in the capitol and then Ned could have turned over the Kingdoms to him. 

You'd probably still have a war with the Lannisters but at least Ned wouldn't of been beheaded, and the Red Wedding wouldn't have happened. 

I really hate they killed Ned off so quickly and I wish there was an alternate series where it played out like this. In general there's a lot of things about the show that I wish went differently such as the whole army of the dead and dragons storylines. I never cared too much about them.

Another part of the show that's insanely frustrating to watch for me is Rickon's death. Why tf did this dumb mfer run in a straight ass line while they shoot arrows at him and he can see them landing right next to him. Like tf you doing, zig and zag bitch.

Edit: another scene that frustrates me is when the Lannisters come for Arya after King Robert dies. Why tf didn't Serio just pick up one of the swords from the dudes he just beat. A lot of dumb people in the GOT world. If you grabbed a sword he may have been able to kill the Kingsguard but noooo let's use that oversized toothpick as a weapon.",game of thrones

"When to use tf.keras vs keras alone? Suppose I'm trying to implement a simple deep learning architecture, with an embedding as my input layer, and a GRU as the middle one, and an output on a sigmoid function activation. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's relatively simple enough that I can do it on keras. But I recently saw that tensorflow has its own implementation of keras with tf.keras. My question is, given the above use case, is there any reason to go for the tensorflow one? Is it better/faster? Or, can I use either anyways?

"Zone density distribution, via computer vision I have a task that may or may not require machine learning.  But it's derived from computer vision data, so I think it may just barely qualify for this sub.

There is a large warehouse with a singular entrance/exit.  The floor is divided into 8 mutually exclusive &amp; exhaustive zones, including the entrance area.  I need to estimate the relative (proportional) distribution of people in each individual zone at any given moment.  That is, at 9am, Zona A has 10%, Zone B has 5%, ..., Zone H has 12%.  The absolute number is of secondary importance.

People inside the warehouse can move freely, although there are a number of physical barriers.  They can also enter/exit the warehouse freely.  Each pair of adjacent zones may have 1 or more routes between them.  And at each boundary, I have a single camera.  Models have been trained to count the gross flow of people from one side of the boundary to the other in discrete intervals.  That is, for a given perimeter line between zones A and B of the floor, I get a 9:00am-9:05am count of people going from zone A to B, and another count from zone B to A.  The attached image gives an idea of floor layout, and the camera placements (in blue).

There is no ground truth to the zone-level distribution.  But I do have very high confidence in knowing the total number of people on the floor at any given time.  I also have a range of confidence in the perimeter cameras, and their ability to estimate between-zone flows.  For example, if I take the camera models at face value, some zones will show cumulative counts of negative people.  Clearly impossible.

I'm struggling with how to define a model that yields my desired outcome.  Nothing seems to quite fit the problem.  But thought the community might have some creative ideas.

Thanks in advance!

"Core technical skills for a Data Analyst? I'm prepping for an online coding bootcamp that has a Data Analytics course, and I'm looking to get ahead as much as I can before starting the course in a couple months. I wanted to get some opinions from you all that hold (or held) this title, what you think are some of the core technical skills that every Data Analyst should have? So far, I have this list--and it mainly comes from the syllabus of the course:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Excel (Statistics, Vlookups, Analytics ToolPak, Pivot Tables)

\- SQL

\- Python (And some packages like: MathPlotLib, Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn)

\- Tableau

\- R (?)

&amp;#x200B;

I, more-or-less, plan on learning/re-learning these concepts in the order that I listed them. If anyone thinks I should do it another way, I'm all ears. Also, if anyone has anything else that they think is essential that I learn to get an edge when I'm out applying for my first position next year, please do not hesitate to share! Likewise, if anyone happens to think anything on this list is unnecessary to learn right now, I'd also like to know. I have a question mark next to R because I'm not sure if it's something I should worry about right now? I'm mainly trying to get an idea of what skills I **definitely** need to get down, when transitioning into an entry level data analyst role. I don't want to get too ahead of myself and get burnt out or prioritize the wrong things. I thought it'd be nice to ask Data Analysts from different companies what they think and then get an idea of what skills overlap/are common and have a better idea of, ""okay that's what I need to learn,"" kind of thing.

\--------

For anyone curious, I'm taking the Data Analytics course from Thinkful. This is an online bootcamp that has a tuition reimbursement guarantee if they can't help me land a job within 6 months of graduating the course. There are requirements, however, such as mandatory meetups with potential employers (which everyone should go to anyway so it's a win-win). Anywho, if anyone is in the same position as me and is looking to transition from a different field to a data analyst, and is interested in my journey of taking an online course such as this, feel free to message me, or follow me, etc. I plan on writing about my experience after the bootcamp is all said and done and if I found a job or not afterwards.

"What kind of machine learning problem is this? For a web scraping project I'm working on, I am supposed to group items based on a set of selection rules imposed on tracks and items. Here is an example below:

Let's say to complete track 1, you have to fulfill the following criteria (selection rules):

1. You must complete A1, A2, and A3
2. You must  select 1 item from the B series and 1 from the C series
3. You must select 1 additional item from either the B or C series
4. You must select both E1 and G1, or all of E2, F1, and K1. I.e select one box \[E1, G1\] or \[E2, F1, K1\]

Other tracks may have similar or different selection rules.

Also, let's assume each item has its own conditions such as:

* To select K1, you must have previously selected H1 and either I2 or J1.
* You can't select both G1 and I1, only one of them.

Other items may have similar or different selection rules.

Is there a way for a program to analyze these rules and?

1. Group items based on the track and/or item requirements, for example, 
   1. Track A can have the items grouped as: \[A1, A2, A3, 1(B), 1(C), 1(B or C), (\[E1, G1\] or \[E2, F1, K1\])\]. 
   2. Item K1 can have its item requirements grouped as \[H1, (I2 or J1)\]
   3. The non-selectability rules can be grouped as (G1 XOR I1) be it for an item selection or track selection rule.
2. Create a list of every possible valid item selection.

"[Spoilers] Cersei’s Deception and The Meaning of Bells   There’s one thing we can be certain of: Cersei is not to be trusted.  Countless characters said throughout the show to not trust Cersei.  The question then arises of how she did it, how she feigned surrender.
  The only way she could’ve done it, is if the bells ringing didn’t truly mean surrender.  This is hinted at in the show when they don’t show Cersei giving the order to ring the bells.  In the show, the bells are rung when one king dies and another king is anointed.  The bells always meant there’s going to be a new king or queen, suspiciously and easily disguising a surrender.  She has a son in her belly, so it rang true.  Or maybe it’s just something new, and she would have a new dragon for her son.  
  This is in the books.  There’s a passage where Tywin says the bells mean there will be a new king, and that’s all that they mean.  So perhaps it should be called Tywin’s deception, not Cersei’s.  
  Cersei doesn’t appear to be in the process of surrendering.  She’s high in the Red Keep with her most dangerous weapon, the Mountain.  She’s not going  towards the exit with a white flag.  In part, surrendering is going to the enemy.  Let’s not forget that Cersei gave the Mountain an order to kill Daenerys, if things went wrong, and it was never shown her cancelling that order.  
  If you look at Daenerys while she’s listening to the bells, she starts to get angry.  She doesn’t look crazy.  She looks like she just realized Cersei was deceiving them with the bells.  Bells can just symbolize something new, maybe with a ‘like a dragon’ added on.  Daenerys knows that if she lands, Cersei will have her killed.  There are likely hired assassins dispersed in the crowd.  She was smart to just burn them.  She was smart to burn down the Red Keep.  She can’t face Cersei without being killed by the Mountain, or who knows how many people in the Red Keep would kill her if she walked in.  
  Daenerys didn’t go crazy(well, she does look crazy in love when she sees John next).  She recognized the threat posed by Cersei.  Cersei is not to be trusted.  There are dozen of ways Cersei could have done it, but I think this angle is best supported by evidence from the books and show.  The bells mean something other than surrender.",game of thrones

"Advice for a new intern in the ML world please Hey everyone, can I please get your advices and suggestions on this. I have some experience with data analysis and machine learning in university. Currently, I am a new intern in a company, and we want to make an automatic system to get a rough indication whether our applicants are suitable or not. The data we have are their LinkedIn profile contents in JSON files (in which we have scraped), and we have data of 2000 'suitable' and 10,000 of 'not suitable'.

My company is keen on using ML to 'predict' whether a candidate is suitable or not, and I'm not very sure about this. Our company has no one with ML or data science expertise, and I'm just a university student with not much knowledge on how ML is actually applied in the workplace. So far, I'm only familiar on using ML for data with numerical and meaningful categorical predictors.

Basically my task is to create an ML model or some sort of automated system to predict/give an indication whether an applicant is suitable based on their LinkedIn profiles. My supervisor is suggesting me to check out Google Cloud AutoML because he said it would be easy to integrate it to our data system (my supervisor is strong on mostly software engineering but does not have much experience on ML or data science). 

Though, I'm not very sure whether it would work. Because data scraped from LinkedIn profiles are most texts and will ML be able to make a proper prediction from that? And we only have a training data of 12,000, in which 2000 are 'suitable'.

Google Cloud AutoML Tables sounds like the most appropriate for our data if we could clean it right, but we have mostly text data. So I'm really unsure about that. I've also been looking at Google BigQuery, which seems like a more appropriate tool to store our JSON data in. And there's BigQuery ML, so would using it be more appropriate? But the question comes back to whether it can even properly use our scraped LinkedIn data to 'predict' suitability. 

I'm still struggling in navigating through all of this because I'm really unfamiliar with the real applications of all these ML stuffs. I'm really confused. Is using ML in this case even possible? Any insights or suggestions you can give me in this case?

"""30-minute in-person technical talk and further interview"" (academic/government data science position) Hi all, it's my first time posting here but I really would appreciate your input on this quote from one of my phone interviewers pertaining to the next step.

Long story short, I've got to the final interview phase of an awesome position as a data scientist, but I've yet to hold a full-time position in the tech industry so I'm inexperienced when it comes to the interview process. After some quick google searches, it seems that ""technical interviews"" usually consist of in-person coding challenges, usually at a whiteboard or otherwise not on a personal computer. I'd be okay with that but my interviewer specifically said the word ""talk"" which gave me the impression of a presentation or something along those lines; not necessarily a coding challenge. But that's all the information I received, no topic, no explanation, and since the job requires a security clearance I don't even know a lot about the specifics of what kind of data I'll be working with yet.

That's my concern, I was hoping somebody here might have gone through something similar in their interview process and would be willing to share some insights. Aside from that, I'm torn between reaching out for clarification (he may already be planning on providing more details, he said it'd be a few weeks before they were ready to schedule) or just overpreparing like crazy.

"[SPOILERS] Question about Ned and season 1 Hi everyone,

I have a question about Ned: 

How did Ned realise that Jaime was the father of Cersei’s kids? 

I understand how he realised that they were not Robert’s kids by looking at that book and checking the hair colours etc. But after that, how did he conclude that it was Jaime who fathered the kids? When I watched that season one episode many years ago, I didn’t question this probably because as a viewer I already knew the situation and I guess this made me not question things further (kind of a psychological reaction). 

But when I think about it further, I actually can’t understand how Ned made this link. Even if I think, ok maybe it’s because he thought only two blonds would create blond kids (going by the hair colour again), then it could still be any blond person? I mean, Jaime and Cersei were close, but then again, it is natural for twins to be close (in normal life as well, without the incest thing). 

Keep in mind, I didn’t read the books, I am just going by the show. So I’m thinking, is the relationship between Cersei and Jaime more visible in the court than they think in the books? Did Ned also hear some rumours like that? Are they more to it in the books? Because again, it feels like a pretty big jump to assume that twins would be in an incest relationship, without eliminating all other possible options before. 

I googled this question and read some discussions in a few other forums, but I wasn’t exactly satisfied with the answers and I am curious what this subreddit is thinking. Plus, I want to actively participate in the discussion if I have any questions arising from the answers. I did a bit of search in this subreddit and couldn't find a related discussion either, but if you know a thread in this subreddit where this question was extensively discussed, please feel free to share the link and sorry for repeating it again.

"Measuring Which Hyper-Parameter Pair Gives Best Performance? Hi there,Let me start of by saying I am not knowledgeable or skillful in statistics, so please talk to me like I'm a five year old. These are my first steps in stats... Be patient please.

Let me explain what I have (1), what I wish for (2), and what I was thinking (3). Hopefully you can help me a bit.  
1) I have tested the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm on a few different environments. For each environment I performed a grid-search on two continues hyper-parameter for this particular algorithm, to see how they impacted performance (= average rewards obtained per episode). Doing so while keeping all the other parameters fixed, obviously. I chose to only test 5 possibilities for each of these continues parameters (so more or less categorical I guess), and repeated these tests a great number of times for each tested setting. I should note that these two hyper-parameters are not independent as one is directly dependent on the other.

2) From visualizations I have created (box-plots most notably) it is quite easy to see which combination(s) of parameters worked best by simply comparing their mean performances. I, however, would like to be more... rigorous and analytical. How can I be more analytical in saying which parameter settings (5 \* 5 = 25 combination pairs in total) work best?

3) First of all, I was thinking about doing ANOVA to see whether the variance across all settings was significant (In other words: are these parameters doing anything?). Is ANOVA applicable, and if so, which variant?  If differences are significant (I'm pretty sure they are), do a post-hoc test to see which combination is best... How? Variances in performances can be quite different... Do Games-Howell test?

"Are 'live' Technical Screens the Norm? This is half rant, half question - as /r/datascience is about the only place with people who I can vent to about this kind of stuff. 

So I'm currently working as a DS for the federal government. The way I ended up here was sort of a strange path but in short there was no real interview, I was doing the work, involved other DS in the organization despite not having that title - and when the title did come available, those who were hiring were already intimately familiar with my skill set so the interview was a bit of a formality. To be fair, this has been the case for much of the last decade, I have let my reputation and work stand for itself and thus never really had interviews. 

Now I find myself potentially having to transition out of this role and switching to a new field completely (where I have no reputation), and have been interviewing with a number of DS roles in the private sector. 

I just had a technical screen for large financial institution, which remarkably was the 3rd of 4 interview steps. The format was in google docs and on the phone, 2 technical leads pasted a problem/puzzle and asked me to code a solution in the language of my choice - in front of them - on a blank google word doc. And I froze up. Literally, I turned into a bunch of 'ummmm, well, ummmm's, very very embarrassing. After a few excruciating minutes, I basically asked if I could just fuck of and do it on my own in jupyter notebook, they said sure all good. 

The allotted time I had was 1hr and I came up with a really nice clean and efficient solution on my own in about 30 minutes and returned it to them.  Honestly, the solution made me say 'fuck yea, thats nice' to myself - but I feel that it may fall on deaf ears due to my first round of performance anxiety. 

So to wade through my post above it comes down to this:

**TLDR;** I am not a script kid, I dont even really consider myself a coder. I'm 'good' at a few languages, but I don't peg myself as fluent beyond the basics (create a dataframe, write an if statement, write a while loop, etc..), but is this on the spot, ""write code for me now monkey"" coding challenge going to be something that is the norm for the industry - or will it be more of a 'you have x amount of time to solve this and submit' type ordeal. Because if the later, I think I'll be ok, if the former, I may need a lot more practice. ",data science

"Coursera canceling access to my prior courses with Coursera Plus? This feels unfair. Hello all,

I have been subscribing to Coursera ([www.coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/)) for years and now they emailed the following canceling access to the courses I've previously taken. I have continued paying for my Cousera subscription for three+ years now, and am ""locked into"" this content and reference it frequently. **I thank Cousera for the high quality content and quality.** The [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai/) specialization in particular was instrumental for me.

That being said, Cousera is now **canceling all prior subscriptions** and forcing them to pair for individual courses.

\- This feels like an unfair practice -- **IMO, prior users should be grandfathered and have the opportunity to keep their current subscription model.** (If the user cancels that subscription it would be expired and no longer available)

"Is it possible to do a coarse-grained max-pool /gating differentiably? (details inside) This question specifically pertains to convolutional neural networks.      
However, for now assume maxpooling over 2 1D vectors, each with 6 channels.

    A = [1,2,3,4,5,6] mean(A) = 3.5     
    B = [4,4,4,4,4.4] mean(B) = 4
____
In your **normal case** :   
 
    Max_pool(A,B) = [4,4,4,4,5,6]     
An element wise max across the 6 channel 

_____
**What I want** instead:
mean(B)&gt;mean(A)      
therefore,      
    
    Max_pool(B,A) = B = [4,4,4,4,4]
____
I want the new maxpooling to act as a gating function for a whole vector, instead of on a per channel basis. Thus, the Max pooling, chooses the vector with maximum activation averaged across all channels.

However, I am not sure how to do it in a neural network such that autograd understands it, and is easily parallelizeable in the same vein as normal maxpooling.

____
My current idea:

    m_A = mean(A)
    m_B = mean(B)
    p = m_A/(m_A + m_B)
    p' = sigmoid(p)
    out = p' *A + (1-p') * B

As I see it, this will act as a soft gating function, However, I can see back propagating through multiple such player being a huge pain (esp. in super deep CNNs and vanishing gradients)

____

Does any one happen to know a better solution ?

Requirements:

* Should be differentiable / back-prop able
* Should be able to be applied in sliding window fashion similar to filters / max pool",data science

"[SPOILERS] Am I the only 1 who absolutely hates Varys? Even before the show begins Jaime mentions how Varys poisoned the ears of the mad king and counseled him to not open the gates for Tywin. Why? What happened to serving the realm?

All he talks about is ""serving the realm"" and the common folk but is that a joke? If that's really your goal Dany sure is an odd choice. He may not have known Dany would turn evil, but she's a conqueror with 3 dragons and an army of rapist Dothraki. Why did he think this would bring peace to Westeros? 

Baelish ends up doing more good than Varys. He saves Sansa twice and kills Joffrey. Varys doesn't do shit but save Tyrion who gives advice so shitty it drove Dany to madness. Killing Tywin is actually what throws the realm (and the show) into shit, Varys should've been supporting him the whole time.

With Maragery as queen and Tywin as the hand that's actually a pretty damn good duo as rulers of the realm. Why tf was he trying to get Dany to rule? And the moment he meets her ""oh I don't like her."" Wtf do you like Varys other than reminiscing on the time you had balls? 

He's pretty useless in the end his spies can't see the golden company, Lannister army, Euron, he can't even see shit flying right at his face. And if Qyburn did effortlessly take over all of his spies why didn't more people do this if it was so simple? You just give candy to a kid and endanger his life?

He promises to tell Dany when she no longer is serving the interests of the common folk and not betray her but all of a sudden he's now team Jon. ""What's that Bran? Your brother is King? Oh well it must be true his best friend told me the same thing."" Then plots to kill her and writes letters on how cool it would be if Jon was king to other lords while Dany is in the next room. He doesn't even know Jon, for all he knows Jon could be a POS.

"Trouble passing a list index through a loop.. Help! (xpost from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48708747/conditional-statement-not-agreeing-with-list-index-in-a-loop))

I'm trying to expand a for loop that I have into a function that will take in 2 arguments: the dataframe, and a list of columns to make changes to.

A more thorough explanation of my problem can be found on that StackOverflow link, but basically the crux of my issue is that when I change from this:

    for (i in 1:length(ID)) {
       # some other code goes here
       df$V1[with(df, pop == paste(ID[i]) &amp; is.na(V1))] &lt;- 0
    }
to this:

    for (i in 1:length(ID)) {
       for (x in 1:length(columnlist)) {
           # some other code goes here
           df[columnlist[x]][with(df, pop == paste(ID[i]) &amp; is.na(df[columnlist[x]]))] &lt;- 0
       }
    }

the latter no longer works. V1 is the column that needs to be worked on, and there are now many many more columns that need to go through the same process (i.e. V1, V2, V3, V4, ... V18 etc).

The problem is that in the second snippet, when I use []'s to specify the columns, then

    pop == paste(ID[i])

no longer works. It executes the first time, but after that it stops. It will also work if I type in the exact string, but I have 400+ of those so that's not a viable option.

"Jupyter Notebook 101 Kickstarter After going to PyCon the last couple of years, I noticed that a lot of people were promoting the Jupyter Notebook for data science both in reproducing research and in sharing their work. I also saw a lot of people using it for presenting their code instead of using MS Powerpoint.

  
So I decided to try writing a book on Jupyter Notebook. It's been going pretty well. If you are interested, you can check out the announcement here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/34257246/jupyter-notebook-101](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/34257246/jupyter-notebook-101)

"[D] Where to apply loss for LSTM Classification problem? For a audio classification problem I'm working on I'm using an LSTM at the end of my network to output predictions. I know that an LSTM will predict values at every time step. When training my classifier should I:
1. Only calculate loss based on prediction of LSTM in last time step?
2. Calculate loss equally across all time steps?
3. Calculate a ""weighted"" loss valuing the correctness of the later time steps over the predictions at earlier time steps?

"Comment > That isn't honorable, that is withholding information that is important to know for a father and a king.

That's true in any other circumstance, he would have told Robert immediately. But when Robert is on his deathbed, telling him accomplishes nothing but to make his suffering worse. Why tell a dying king that his wife cheated on him and the Lannisters have stolen the throne when it's too late for him to do anything about it?

Ned could have told him and then promised to take care of it for him, but again that accomplishes nothing, Ned was going to take care of it anyway, so all it does is make Robert's dying hours worse on him. Honor doesn't require doing that, he wanted his friend to die in peace.

> He did infact not write Robert's will down as it was told to him, he did not show honor in that vein. Robert may have not known Jeffrey was not his son, but that is who he wanted to be his successor.

If Robert had known, there is absolutely no doubt he would have disowned Joffrey and named Stannis his heir, and Ned knows this.  Ned intends to carry out what Robert's will would have been, without bothering to tell him something so unpleasant. His actions were entirely honorable... and maybe you disagree, but the point is that Ned thought this was the honorable choice.",game of thrones

"[NO SPOILERS] Any interest in voice acting in a GoT radio play podcast? Hi all! I recently finished writing my own six episode Season 8. It was purely for fun and to spend time in the world of GoT; I'm a huge fan (my left arm is covered in tattoos of house sigils) but like a lot of people I was really disappointed (to put it mildly!) with the final season we got. I like to think my scripts put right a lot of the major issues, but also take things in interesting and surprising directions. Very few of the characters end up where they did in the show proper.

I'm currently working on the idea of recording the scripts as a radio play and putting them online as a podcast. 

Long story, short, I'd love to hear from anybody that might have an interest in providing one or potentially multiple character voices. If so, please do let me know you age/sex/accent etc and if there's anyone in particular you think you'd be a good fit for. *Just to be totally clear, this is just a bit of fun (hopefully) between fans, so there's no remuneration or professional credits involved.* If there is interest, I can move forward with the logistics of recording/editing etc, and if there's not, well, I'll be happy to just go back to writing my Robert's Rebellion prequel series (Season 1 available on Reddit, if anyone's interested or wants to get a sense of my writing before expressing interest in the radio play of Season 8).

[SPOILERS] Why do the Wildlings climb the wall when they can go around it with boats? I understand that the white walkers in the show cannot swim or pass through water for whatever reason. But why do the wildlings resort to climbing the wall when it would be much easier and more realistic to just build a boat and sail around the wall on the east or west side. I know they are wildlings so they probably don’t know much about boat building but they must have a sense of it and could makeshift some rafts. Is it because the edges of the wall are guarded? Because from what I remember castle black was the only heavily guarded castle and it’s because the tunnel must be guarded.

"[Spoilers] How the Long Night should have ended As the Night king stood in front of Bran ready to take back what he desired for centuries, suddenly the wights were surrounded by the Dothraki and vanished into flames by Drogon, who was there to take care of any more wights entering the area where the weirwood tree lay.What stood between the Night King and his mission for a Long night was 2 warriors, Jon, and Jaime. Seeing the prospect and with a thirst to not leave any stones or in this case, bodies unturned, he brought out his sword. he could very well understand that both of them had Valyrian steel so he knew what he was up against, But he was the Night King.

Both of them charged and then the battle began, One that was foreshadowed years ago and the one for redemption, which Jaime had been fighting for ever so long. They came and fought, twisted and turned and the Night king made them look like 2 amateurs up against a seasoned professional. As John finally succumbed and lay on the ground, almost breathless, Jaime looked up and realized this was the moment his whole was waiting for. He could finally let go of Cersei and had found real love and he had gotten everything that he had ever wanted, except, redemption.

With one last breath, he went one for a 1v1 that children in the future would sing songs about. As the swords collided and they clashed with all their might, Jaime was almost done, on his last breath, as the Night King took Jaime's own sword, forged by Tywin from the noble Ned Stark's Ice, and plunged into his heart. With a look of pain but satisfaction, Jaime tumbled to the ground, on the way to go back to his mother and father when all of a sudden from behind John lay one last charge, But as valiantly as he fought, The Night King got the better of him and plunged his dagger right until a body leapt on him, who could that be he thought, No one would be the answer.

As the King's sword entered Jon, Arya also pulled the infamous dagger, that started the show and the war of the five kings and Plunged it onto the night king, finally settling the long night at last. This time, Azhor ahai and Lightbringer were two different but they had achieved what he had before.

With his last breath lay on Arya's arms with Sansa and Dany in behind. With one last look at his family and tears from his eyes and a smile of satisfaction, of finally achieving his destiny he closed his eyes. Azhor ahai had came and gone back again.",game of thrones

"Data Science Project Structure Questions Good day, all! 

I'm new to this sub and I thought I'd start with a question I've been struggling with on my data science learning path. I work as a Senior BI analyst at a company who's seeking to engage in data science initatives. I've been very interested in the field for a while as a natural progression of data analysis. Most of the things I've worked on have consisted of scripts/functions running inside of other applications (i.e. Spotfire, Tableau, Power BI). Obviously this doesn't scale very well so I've been exploring using and setting up open source solutions utilizing cloud resources to train and host models. I've been using docker as a virtual environment of sorts after my first attempts at using Conda left me rebuilding venv repeatedly after not properly setting up pip. This has served me well with tasks as I can build up a template image from a base and save off multiple customized images then deploy those images out based on my needs. My latest endeavor has been using an automated project templating tool called kedro. kedro is a python package which prefers to use conda to pass package requirements to other individuals or resources running the project files.  

Data pipelines aside my question here is what is the best way to incorporate docker, a virtual environment, and or project management package (i.e. kedro)?

"[S] Older versions of SAS expose PII in .sas7bdat files From [this blog post](https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2021/10/a-bug-and-dilemma.html)

&gt; A few months ago, I discovered that the SAS statistical software package, which is used worldwide by universities and other large organisations to analyse their data, contained—until quite recently—a bug that could result in information that the user thought they had successfully deleted (and was no longer visible from within the application itself) still being present in the saved data file. This could lead to personal identifiable information (PII) about study participants being revealed, alongside whatever other data might have been collected from these participants, which—depending on the study—could potentially be extremely sensitive....

&gt; ...

&gt; I have been told by SAS support (see screenshot below) that this bug was fixed in version 9.4M4 of the software, which was released on 16 November 2016. The support agent told me that the problem was known to be present in version 9.4M3, which was released on 14 July 2015; however, I do not know whether the problem also existed in previous versions.

1. make your model more flexible; anticipate the additional ask

My friend said that Varys knows everything thanks to his little birds, and Pycelle planned to make Tyrion think that Varys knows the plan and told it to the queen. But, it makes everything worse because if it could be, then Varys might have known the plot and consciously told the queen about the plan.

In conclusion, his plot was based on the stupidity of Pycelle. I know, Tyrion already knew that the plot will work, but it was only because Varys is his friend, and he knows how stupid Pycelle is. So, I think it was a threat instead of a plot.

"[SPOILERS] My drunk rant about the ending 🙃 Okay about the ending...

Probably going to get a lot of down votes but I have to just say I still really liked the end of the show.
I just see so many posts and memes shitting on it I wanted to know if there was anyone else out there that felt the same. 

1. Was it the most perfect ending? No. There are many other ways I would have preferred it ending but that doesn't mean the way it did end was horrible.

2. Was it rushed? Yes and I am sure there are reasons for this outside of the show itself that I do not know about, I am not one of the fans that disects and does all the production research so I should have just not mentioned this point really.

3. Danaerys. Yes, she goes batshit crazy which kinda seems like opposite of what she was all about but at the same time, she has gone through so fucking much honestly any human being could lose their minds after what she has been through. 

4. The books. This mother trucker STILL hasn't written another book. They had nothing to go off of for the ending!!! There is a reason mr. George is famous and that's because he made all this shit up in his head and did we really expect the show writers to just be as amazing as he was? They had enorenormous pressure to end a story that millions of people fell in love with and they weren't even the ones who came up with it in the first place. Sure, he gave them some major plot points and pointed them in the right direction but there was no way they could have came up with the same level of material as he would, especially when he can't even end the damn thing!!

All in all I dont see how the ending was horrible, was it perfect? No but it was still a great story and to those people who say the ending ruined the entire show and no one should even bother watching, fuck that. Even of you didn't like the ending, you cannot fucking say the first however many seasons weren't fucking amazing.

However can I even use ANOVA? I know the independent variable needs to be categorical, and i'm not sure if picking a specific duration of time (which as a quantity is continuous) but using 5 specific durations of time (e.g. 1 millisecond of stimulation, 2 millisecond of stimulation and so on) means that the independent variable is categorical or not.

"[SPOILERS] Book vs. Show preferences. Any scenes in the show you prefer to the book? 
I just finished A Feast for Crows, and have yet to read A Dance With Dragons. Obviously the books are far richer and are still ongoing while the show is not, and each is their own medium. I was wondering if there are any scenes from the show that you enjoyed more than how it was originally depicted in the book, and why. 

For me, Tyrion’s trial hit better in the show. His speech culminating in his request for trial-by-combat while he doesn’t know he will have a champion in Oberyn? Amazing. Maybe I’m biased to Peter Dinklage’s performance, but I felt he was at his wit’s end in the show and knew his last resort was the biggest insult to Tywin. In the book it just felt less fiery to me, I guess. 

I do prefer Jaime confessing the Tysha lie to Tyrion. It let’s Tyrion know that he is lovable. In the show it’s just never brought up.

"Many Categorical Outputs vs a Single Continuous output I am building a system where we need to check if 2 sentence embeddings are a ""match"" in terms of semantic similarity. So I'm designing a linear model that will take 2 sentence embeddings as input and I'm confused to what I should design the model to output. 

I need to know 2 things about these sentences:
(a) A binary category: Do these 2 sentences ""match"" or not. 
(b) If they do match, what is the quality of the match (are these 2 sentences semantically identical or weakly related). 

In my mind, the model should have a single output neuron with a single value which will be the ""quality"" of the match and then convert that into a binary decision based on a threshold (I'll use a ROC to decide what the threshold should be) 

In literature however, I've not found that people are doing that. In particular, I'm looking at Ryan Kiros et al's Skip Thought Vector paper: For semantic relatedness, each pair of sentences in the data is assigned a class between 1 and 5 where 1 is not related at all and 5 indicates highly related. Their output layer has 5 neurons. Each representing the probability of a pair of sentences belonging to the class 1,2,3,4,5. 

Why would they do this categorical output instead of using a singular continuous output? Does it provide more information? ",data science

Basically the title. I've got a project where the Data Science team is processing a large amount of data as part of the ETL pipeline. In Prod I only need the output. It will be static dashboarding and no ML needs to be done in Production. 


I'm confused exactly how Dev and Staging would work. The reason being if I am building my ETL Pipeline in Dev, you'd think I'd be testing with Sample Data that's very representative to what I'd seen in Production. But in the current project the Data Science team is working directly with Production Data. Why? Mainly because it's batch data that can be processed monthly, but also because it's fairly unstructured data. 

So if in Dev I am attempting to process production data correctly. Once it's processed. Does that mean in staging / prod I re-run the pipeline? 

Or would in Dev I attempt to use Sample Data for the ETL portion. In staging I can use ""production"" data. And if that all works I just push the output to a the production DB since there is no point and re-running it?

"[No Spoilers] I have problems with Tolkien Fans bashing GRR Martin and other recent fantasy authors doing more Rated R stuff because not only as attempts been done before n the genre and old mythology has them but plenty of works across mediums including high art stuff done it before Tolkien died I'm gonna start off with by stating two years before Tolkien's death, a 1971 MacBeth move was released. Highly praised by critics and considered easily one of the best adaptations as well as perhaps the most famous movie of the play at least among American audiences. IN this version, not only is open nudity is shown but there is far open blood and gore including a beheading scene of the tragic protagonist with a lot of blood splatter. Not only is he killing o children and other civilians shown onscreen without sanitizing it, but this incarnation even shows an open gangrape scene where a peasant girl is screaming as she's being penetrated while the bandits are all laughing like its a game.

Now this was released 2 yeas before Tolkien's death..........

Which why I think its a bit tiresome of how not just A Song of Ice and Fire and GRR Martin and recent authors who do a far darker and gorier take of fantasy (in a lot of case still remaining at PG-13 content and using the black and white morality Tolkien gets criticized for by modern audiences) keeps getting bashed for turning the fantasy genre into ""pulp"" fiction.

News flash while they remain more discreet about the details or at least don't go to the far extent Tolkien did, fantasy authors before him and even his contemporaries had already skirted around stuff like child trafficking, torture, if not even directly touched it.

To put Howard as an example, I just read my first Conan story ever and without putting spoilers a queen is sent to a palace dungeon afer her city fell. The text avoids directly saying anything but its not too hard to infer the queen was tortured and probably raped. ANd the rest of the story openly states stuff like humans being captured and sold into slaery for profits by the new rulers of the city.

Now let me comment on Martin. I am in no way siding with Martin's fandom and I actually think Martin is not just overrated and a pretty bad writer. Specifically concerning his very sexual and bloody setting, I actually even support people who thinks he's gone mainstream in attracting audiences through shock and awe and is at the core pretty pulp in style. SO I actually agree with attacking Martin as exploitive.

But I think a lot of fans of Tolkien goes to far in attacking Martin and authors who's been following the Rated M For Mature (Rated R equivalent for videogames for those who don't know trend) in attacking them as being weak writers who only can grip readers by shock value and making comments like how sheltered this generation of humans are because they find rape and genocide with bloody fight scenes as appealing and fail to understand how horrifying these stuff are and other comments of that nature. I think its very shortsighted, elitist, and not just insulting but even outright ignorant.......

Because its not just contemporaries of Tolkien who wrote stuff in the fantasy genre touching Game of Thrones type of stuff, but plenty of mythology including the stuff Tolkien read and loved already did ASOIAF content centuries erlier.

I just finished Homer for the first time. What saw in The Illiad in particular genuinely surprised me. To start off the battle scenes are full of description of blood spilling, open wounds from sword slashes and spear stabs, decapitations of the limbs, and brains bashing out in bits because of weapons smashing the skull, so much more that is literally at the level of Bravehart and the recent Spartacus TV show. We aren't even counting the morally wrong stuff like Achilles having a female slave where is implied he has control over her and can do anything he wants including force her to give him sexual favors.

La Morte D'Arthur has a lot of treachery and backstabbing to bring a story that Tolkien specifically loved. Even Tolkien's favorite tale Beowulf has a brutal fight scene where a humanoid monster's arm is cut off by Beowulf pulling it with brute force.

And we don't even need to stick to fantasy and mythology specifically or even just books and live stage plays like Tennessee Williams and Shakespeare. In addition to 1971 MacBeth movie, you can see so many stuff across high art works in other mediums. To put just one example, the drama movie A Streetcar Named Desire has a rape scene just before its conclusion (even though it flashes out in the middle of the attack). This is considered one of the best movies of all time and with acting so powerful its not just Marlon Brando's breakout role, but its Vivien Leigh's second Academy Award win as best actress. It was released 3 years before LOTR was published.

So yes I do agree Martin should be criticized for pushing shock value but so many fans of Tolkien's works often make comments criticizing Rated R content as not just inherently bad and pop culture pulpish but even seem to act like this stuff is all new.

Just go read any of the Eddas that Tolkien loved and well any mythology period because these stuff are not white and black cleancut Disney fairytales. You don't even need strictly high art like Golden Age academy award winning movies and modern Musicals that won Tony. Even stuff thats doing high quality serious level in recent time before Martin's books were made into a TV show were already reaching this level of dark like The Sopranos and HBO's Rome and to put a comic book example, Watchman.

So I honestly think attacking works for fantasy for featuring nudity, rape scenes mass murders, etc is very shortsighted from Tolkien fans considering Homer's Odyssey opens up with Odysseus's crew sacking a town and killing a lot of inhabitants, sparing only women for future ""pleasure"" (implied intention for rape and sexual slavery) and perhaps a few children before being forced o retreat bck to their ships because of an army marching to the sacked community intending to fight them.

"Military Intelligence Analyst to Data Analyst Hey r/datasciene
I currently work as an RF field engineer and have been thinking about making the move back to data analysis since separating from the military 2 years ago. 

I have a background in IT as a database administrator and unix/linux system administrator as well as over 15 years experience looking at small and large unstructured data sets to aid decision makers in the military and federal government. 

My formal education is in Computer Science (A.S.), Anthropology (B.S.) and looking at some certificate programs UCSD or ASU, but I'm open to suggestions.

Most of the software I've used has been proprietary, but have lots experience writing SQL queries, data and text mining, data visualization, predictive analysis using linear regression models and risk management. I've also had coursework in statistics and SPSS. 

What skills should I brush up on to make myself competitive in this field? 

How do I best present my experience to potential employers?

What industry's/ market sectors should I be looking for employment in... in my neck of the woods (Las Vegas) I've seen looks for jobs geared towards travel and tourism, I'm also willing to telecommute or work from home is the opportunity presents itself.

"Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm  **The hierarchical Clustering algorithm** is another popular unsupervised [Machine Learning](https://deepblade.com/category/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/) algorithm. It is able to group unlabeled datasets into clusters. It means this algorithm is allowed to identify similarities and differences in data points and divide them into several groups.

As you may remember, in [K-Means clustering](https://deepblade.com/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/k-means-clustering-algorithm/), we have to decide the number of clusters(K) first. But here we do not need to decide the number of clusters first. That is an advantage of Hierarchical Clustering.

&amp;#x200B;

In this tutorial, you will learn,

* [Different approaches of Hierarchical Clustering](https://deepblade.com/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/hierarchical-clustering/#1)
   * Agglomerative Clustering
   * Divisive Clustering

## 

## Different approaches of Hierarchical Clustering

There are two types of Hierarchical Clustering.

**Note:** Here we will build a hierarchy of clusters using **Dendrogram**. It is a type of tree diagram showing relationships between sets of data.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nz11b6qxwez71.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22e89f8a3e6a477e33399386e49611dec4b9f12

### 

### Agglomerative Clustering

Here it decides that each data point belongs to a separate cluster. Then measure the distance between each cluster and combine the nearest pair of clusters. In that way, the adjacent cluster pair merges and finally gives us a single cluster with all the data points. It follows the Bottom-Up approach according to the above diagram.

### 

### Divisive Clustering

Here it decides that all the data points belong to the same cluster and then split the farthest in a different cluster. In that way repeat this process until each data point belongs to a separate cluster. It works the opposite way of Agglomerative Clustering and it follows the Top-Down approach according to the above diagram.

## 

## How does Hierarchical Clustering work?

Let’s talk about how **Agglomerative Clustering** works with a simple dummy dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g45j9dx2xez71.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=162346c9d5a700fce4292e6ae15c9bf9c136e24d

In this way, there are 7 data points. I have named them in the alphabetic order of the English alphabet.

&amp;#x200B;

You may remember, in **Agglomerative clustering**, decides that each data point belongs to a separate cluster. So, there have 7 clusters. Here the centers of those clusters are located on the data points. The centers are shown as red dots.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im7ch4v6xez71.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e67cdae763fc28a0f56b74dc3e6cbb7b9e55d582

Now find the nearest pair of clusters and combine that pair into a single cluster. Then there are now 6 clusters.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etqq1pkaxez71.png?width=1347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=061a1e38f155bb1ed7e77e8736e160e9a8fc3cfa

**Note:** To select the nearest pair of clusters, we need to measure the distance between clusters. For that, we can use methods like,

* Euclidean distance
* Manhattan distance
* Cosine distance

&amp;#x200B;

As in the step above, the nearest cluster pair merges and finally gives us a single cluster with all the data points. Here the number of clusters decreases one by one with each iteration. You can also get a clear idea of the functionality here by studying the **dendrogram**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ffy42uacxez71.gif

## How do choose the Number of Clusters in Hierarchical Clustering?

We can decide the optimal value of clustering by looking at the dendrogram. Its y-axis is the distance. Therefore, we can determine the number of clusters by studying the dendrogram or by using a threshold value for distance.

The greater the distance between the clusters, the longer the vertical lines of the dendrogram. With that, we can choose a more distant opportunity. For example, if we draw a horizontal line in the dendrogram like below, we can get two clusters.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c1p3hd8gxez71.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486922c88f96f300b4fde6a7a1318fdd46317fcf

## 

## Applications of Hierarchical Clustering

### 

### Market Segmentations

Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, we can cluster all customers for different groups using different market segmentations.

### 

### Search engines

When we search for something through a search engine, the search results should be included in a certain group. In those cases, we can get a group that matches what we searched for through a clustering algorithm.

### 

### Recommendation Systems

Depending on what we are looking for in a recommendation system, it will repeatedly recommend other things in the same group. A Clustering algorithm is used therefor do that job.

## 

## Practical implementation of Hierarchical Clustering

Let’s implement the **Hierarchical Clustering algorithm** using machine learning libraries in [Python](https://deepblade.com/category/programming/python-programming/). I do that using simple dummy data points.

Let’s follow the steps below.

1. Create a Pandas DataFrame
2. Visualize the dataset
3. Plot a Dendrogram
4. Train a model using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
5. Visualize the Clusters

### 

### Create a pandas DataFrame

`# import necessary libraries`  
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`  
`import pandas as pd`  


`# create a simple dataframe`  
`data = pd.DataFrame(data={'x': [0, 1.1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5],`  
`'y': [0, 1.5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, 4]})`

## 

## Visualize the dataset

`# plot datapoints as a scatter-plot`  
`plt.scatter(df.x, df.y)`  


`# numbering data-points`  
`numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`  
`for indx, txt in enumerate(numbers):`  
   `plt.annotate(txt, (df.x[indx], df.y[indx]), size=12)`

### 

https://preview.redd.it/o7ac2cnlxez71.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1a717d8f0966b1ccf91ab697cb859976164e98f

### 

### Plot a Dendrogram

`import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sc`  
`dendrogrm = sc.dendrogram(sc.linkage(data, method = 'ward'))`  
`plt.title('Dendrogram')`  
`plt.show()`

### 

https://preview.redd.it/i6dosfhpxez71.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f696bdc30e30d08867fab05655d5f169bbb4b77

&amp;#x200B;

### Train a model using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

`from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering`  
`model = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters = 3, affinity = 'euclidean', linkage = 'ward')`  
`pred = model.fit_predict(data)`  
`print(pred)`  


`OUTPUT:`   
`[0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2]`

&amp;#x200B;

* In here we use 3 as **‘n\_clusters’**. Therefore the dataset is divided into three clusters.
* **‘affinity’** represents the metric that is used to compute the linkage. There are a few metrics that can be used for that. (“euclidean”, “manhattan”, “cosine”, “precomputed”) 
* **‘linkage’** criterion determines which distance to use between sets of observation. There are a few linkages like “ward”, “average”, “single”, “complete”.

Learn more about [sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html)

&amp;#x200B;

`data['cluster'] = pred`  
`data`

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/opndi40txez71.png?width=179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=458f68ae56007014f82e6c14ba2af5fad8cc39a3

### 

### Visualize the Clusters

`cluster1 = data[data['cluster']==0]`  
`plt.scatter(cluster1['x'], cluster1['y'])`  


`cluster2 = data[data['cluster']==1]`  
`plt.scatter(cluster2['x'], cluster2['y'])`  


`cluster3 = data[data['cluster']==2]`  
`plt.scatter(cluster3['x'], cluster3['y'])`

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91ldwm4vxez71.png?width=469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0c3f9076abea2f01f3745405ca85c9dbbf5988

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can see that the data is clustered as we thought. We can change the number of clusters(“n\_neighbors”) as we want and see this.

"[SPOILERS] Re-watched and everything Dany did was believable until... I watched the show in real time as it aired, which was difficult as by the latter seasons I had forgotten a lot of the details of the early seasons. The end was a shock and disappointment to me as it was to many.

But then I re-watched the series within a couple of months and the continuity of the story and characters held up much better in the re-watch. Yes, it's true, certain things seemed rather far-fetched, such as Varys throwing his normal caution to the wind, but by and large the main problem I'd had with the show in the first viewing was drastically reduced.

Dany's nature doesn't really change throughout the show. If you re-watch it you will see Dany as the ruthless tyrant she is destined to become, even in the earlier seasons. Like most tyrants, she is generous and kind to those who are faithful and obedient to her. In the early seasons, when she kills people, we are rooting for her because we think the people she's killing suck.

The assault on King's Landing episode is actually quite powerful if you look at it and ignore Dany. The fact that the northerners turn into murdering rapists is more interesting and sad than anything Dany does - it shows the true horror of warfare. They're supposed to be the good guys.

And this episode is the one time that I find Dany acts out of character and it makes little sense. Everything she does up to the ringing of the bells is fine and consistent with her character. Was the writing as good in Season 8 as Season 1-4? No. But Dany's character consistency is mostly fine. Up to the ringing of the bells.

Cercei and her army were backstabbers. Dany and her army literally saved the world and Cercei sat there and waited to stab them in the back. It would be like - imagine aliens attacked earth and, like a Hollywood movie, the USA tried to rally the world's militaries in defense. Imagine the major powers agreed to put aside their differences and fight the aliens together. Imagine it's a brutal war with astronomical casualties, but we somehow pull it off. Except one country, China, decided to sit the war out and build up their army, and when the aliens are finally defeated China goes on a rampage and  invades the USA. It would be the most evil thing a nation has ever done in the history of our species. By sitting the war out for their own personal gain, they would have put the entire human species in jeopardy. I would consider it the worst betrayal in history, the worst crime.

This is what Cercei does. The army of the dead seems to be about to exterminate all life and it seems the night king will win, and yet Dany fights against him despite the odds, and Cercei uses the events to her advantage. It's a truly evil betrayal and Cercei and the entire Lannister army deserve to be vaporized by dragonfire. The Golden Company too.

So Dany flying around and nuking the shit out of the army makes sense. If she had completely blown up the Red keep that would make sense too. ~~But why does she take her time flying up and down the streets to burn the irrelevant peasants running away? THAT makes no sense.~~

~~She's trying to conquer the city, to live in it, to sit on the throne. It makes no sense for her to turn it to ash first. She's not even getting revenge on anyone at that point. It would even make more sense for her to burn down Casterly Rock, or blow up the Iron Bank. The city of King's Landing has been her dream her whole life. Burning it and all the people within it is unexplainable.~~

~~And that scene, where she takes off after the bells ring, looking at the Red Keep... and then spends hours burning everything other than the Red Keep - that makes no sense.~~

I've read the explanations offered in this thread and I thought about the dialogue in the last episode more and yes, even Dany's burning of KL does make sense and is consistent with her character. I think most of us still agree it was a dick move of D&D to condense the final two seasons and this descent into genocide should have been given more than one episode, but ultimately it is consistent with Dany's previous path/trajectory.

"Is this an issue of pseudoreplication? Lets say I have 3 grassland plots that are separate from each other, (i.e. several km apart) and I take an NDVI pixel value for each plot per year. I am interested in how NDVI responds to precipitation. Precipitation values per year are the same for each plot. 

For example 



Year | Precip (mm)| NDVI Plot 1 | NDVI Plot 2 | NDVI plot 3
---|---|----|----|----

1996| 320 | 0.7 | 0.5 | 0.4
1997| 274 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.3

I then regress NDVI (y axis) against precipitation (x axis) such that there are 3 points of NDVI per each precipitation value.

I then compare this to 3 sites of a different vegetation type (e.g) in the same general area, such that the precipitation value/year is the same for all sites.

"[SPOILERS] Jaime & Cersei Welcome to ""I wrote down my shower thoughts after getting way too deep into a topic nobody else cares about"".

I think this has definitely been discussed at length previously by others, but here's my two cents (which I am aware that _nobody_ asked for). 

Cersei was never truly _in love_ with Jaime.

I think she learned from a young age what her life was expected to be (e.g. an obedient wife and loving mother) and we all know she obviously wanted to be more than that. 

I think she saw everything she wanted to have for herself in Jaime, and I think she was so terrified of the thought of being handed over to whoever her husband would be, she clung onto Jaime and manipulated him into loving her so that she could always have some element of control over _something_ she recognised and understood, and who would love her unconditionally, when she knew that she would perhaps have very little control in other areas of her life.

I think she was intensely jealous of everything Jaime had that she wasn't allowed (training, fighting etc.), and perhaps wanted to live vicariously through him, and the only way she knew how to keep him around was to let him become obsessed with her. 

For a start, Jaime has never been with another woman but Cersei (I'm going on the books here so let's ignore the Brienne stuff _for now_), whereas Cersei is quite happy to take others to her bed (Lancel) and admits that at first, she _did_ ""love"" King Robert until he called her Lyanna. 

If she truly loved Jaime, of course she would have shared a bed with her husband because she _can't not_, but she wouldn’t have taken others to bed. 

She isn't even overjoyed when he returns from being held captive. She's very sharp and spiteful with him, blaming him for abandoning her. There's very little understanding or forgiveness; if she loved him, she'd have been overjoyed to be reunited. Without him, she had little control or influence over anything, and so she feels as if his absence is a personal slight against her - _how could he be so selfish as to leave her alone in the Capital?_ There's very little regard for his wellbeing outside of how his return will benefit _her_. 

With regards to Jaime, he knows it's wrong to love Cersei, but he can't seem to break away from her, until _Brienne_, and I think when Brienne finally starts to show him some compassion and understanding, he begins to realise that that’s what _love_ is (whether it's romantic or platonic), and that Cersei has _never_ given him that.

I think in the next two books, we'll see Jaime finally break away from Cersei when he realises that she never truly loved him; she just loved to control him. 

If he doesn't enter a romantic relationship with Brienne, then the two will have an immensely strong friendship, and she will be the one to help him heal.

I think Jaime will be the one to kill Cersei in the end (as the Valonqar). I think he may have an internal battle regarding his feelings for her because she's twisted him so much, but I think he'll relent and realise that she's incapable of thinking about anyone but herself (assuming all her children are dead, which I think they will be).

Does Cersei love Jaime? Yes, as her brother and as her play-thing, but I do not think she is, or has ever been in love with him.",game of thrones

"(Academic)(Survey) Are you an Engineer and/or Designer? A few months ago, we (a group of researchers from the University of Michigan) posted a survey asking about your approach to engineering and design. With your help, we were able to develop a scale for measuring engineering and design attitudes! A paper summarizing the findings has been accepted to the 2019 International Conference on Engineering Design and will appear in the conference proceedings in the coming months. A few slides containing a quick summary of the study and its outcomes are [linked here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmlj4oczazew51c/HUM00154807_Recruitment%20Slides.pptx?dl=0).

We were surprised and delighted by the number of responses from Reddit (n=369). Thank you! It is also worth noting that the results from the Reddit responses were similar to responses from verified industry experts to whom we distributed the survey.

**Current Study:**

We are now running a second study to understand the relationship between these attitudes and performance on analytical reasoning and divergent thinking tasks. Please see below for the invitation to the current study.

Study Recruitment:

You are invited to participate in a research study on attitudes about engineering and design, and the relationship between these attitudes and performance on analytical reasoning and divergent thinking tasks. In order to participate, you must be an engineer, designer, or other STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) professional/student at least 18 years of age.

If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete a survey and five short answer questions in Qualtrics, an online survey platform. You will also be asked to complete some demographic questions. The study will take 15-20 minutes total. The study has been approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board \[HUM00154807\].

Please review the informed consent document [linked here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/roqk7ckjy6jdo44/HUM00154807_Adult%20Consent.docx?dl=0). If you would like to participate, follow the link below:

"Creating a text classification model to identify meaningful use cases and relationship types in a given text  I am working on a text classification problem and end goal is to create an python application which will create / generate UML diagrams (use-case, class, activity, sequence) when given a text requirement. So imagine you have a written simple text software requirement given by a customer. This text will contain basics of what should happen in the software. For example:

* User should be able to sign up to the system.
* User should be able to sign in to the system.
* Warehouse Operator should be able to create orders by uploading a csv file.
* Warehouse Operator should be able to make adjustments to the order.
* Warehouse Operator should be able to allocate a vehicle for a job.

So I want to create a text classification model which will analyze this text and identify actors, class names, class methods / functions, meaningful use cases, relationship types which will help me to generate UML diagrams. In order to do this I understand that some Natural Language Processing also should be done. I am hoping to use Spacy for NLP. To generate / create UML diagrams I'm hoping to use Graphviz.

Shonklas...

I had to ask my dad what that meant...in fact I'm just now realizing English was clearly not my first language and I have a lot of word fusions in there for words I couldn't think of the English term for, so I would mix up the closest works I can find and smooshing them together...

So another thing to note...Xunolu was never inlove with the original vampire boyfriend and I made it a point that she never said I love you to him, just to her...

With him she used tequiro...with her she use te amo and did the only context she gave him was ""it means I love you"" but I was making it obvious she was lying..

To put into context
Te quiero means (I want you in the literal sense)
So while Native English speakers think it means sexual desire 
It was actually what we said to our family members.. 

So while she finds him sexually attractive, she knows he's trying to use her, so she decides to use him instead. That's why no matter what sexual activity happened between the two...it always amused her that he believed she was obsessed so she thought it was funny to tell him te quiero when they were done

So here is where shonclass come in
Apparently it means both cup and shoe...

So if I was the shoe....

My dad just practically confirmed that Disney stole my idea and everything makes so much sense on why I thought the movies were so weird...

I got to go behind the scenes and see how animations were made, and the Ice queen was already a work in progress but they couldn't figure out how to make it family friendly...then after 911, a lot of the people who worked there did actually talk to me about it when my dad was away but I don't really remember that... so they wanted to put it into a context that a child good understand. A few years later I tried to do it myself since no one my age wanted to talk about these topics

So they did see my work
And I wonder if the reason Elsa is no longer the villain because of me

And the second movie gets better.
My dad is black but I am white...

I couldn't understand why other white kids kept calling me names like albino, Casper, demon girl...

My dad tried to explain that it's because even though I look white, he is my father and he is black, so that makes me gray.. 
Then I said that's why everyone hates me im so ugly...

Then they wrote me a story called you are special
It was a story about puppets and essentially a re imagined version of Pinocchio

It was about a boy puppet in a society where people will give eachother gold stars or Grey dots based on looks or talent. Even though everyone was a puppet and they looked the same ""Pinocchio"" got a Grey dots because his nose grew

When people saw he had so many Grey dots they gave him more Grey dots...

He tried everything he could think of to get those stars, but no matter what, he would fail and get more Grey dots.

Then one day he meets a girl who had no stickers at all!!!

He asked her, why don't you have stickers?

She said 
I KNOW WHO MADE ME SO I DONT NEED THEM ANYMORE

She offered to introduce him, 
To the man who made every puppet in the world 
But he was scared

I HAVE TOO MANY GREY DOTS...
I DONT HAVE ANY STARS 

but she assured him that he didn't care about that at all and would go with him

When he meets the guy who made him he asks
Why did you make me wrong?

He said what makes you think that???

Well just look at me! I'm covered in Grey! I don't have a single gold star...

He says, that's OK, I love you, I'm proud of what I made

Then the puppet says, if you love me, will you give me a star???

He says No, you are special and perfect just the way you are 

But everyone hates me with so many Grey dots

Then he says every time someone gives you a sticker remember this, I made you and I made them...

No one needs stickers to prove how special you are

As he left the stickers started falling off...they tried to replace it with more Grey dots but it never stuck!

Eventually when all the dots were off, people tried giving him gold stars 

But it didn't stick either, but he didn't care

He finally found a place to belong",game of thrones

"[SPOILERS] Why are 99% of the slaves in the show people of darker skin colour? I get why most of the actors are white, no problem. It's based on medieval Europe and all that. But why are all the slaves black people or brown/olive-skinned people? In particular, the scenes when Daenerys goes around and free sall the slave cities.

It's very obvious there's no or very few white people in the slave groups and I get a very weird ""white saviour"" vibe in that scene when they all lift up Daenerys and cheer her on. 

I could buy that that these slave cities have different coloured skins because they are in different locations and are of different races, but the slave masters are all white as well (bar the one guy at Qarth who lets them in)... which seems to make no sense at all. 

Is there something to this lore-wise (I'm genuinely asking — did some foreigners from the ""white"" mainland come and capture these ""minority"" citizens or something like that?) or... is the show just being racist?

"Comment Littlefinger never learned the key lesson about his biggest weakness, despite multiple examples of why it was such a huge flaw. He was trying to play the game alone, with no-one around him he could truly trust to be loyal.

He himself demonstrated to Ned the risk you take walking into a room reliant on men whose 'loyalty' to your side is far from absolute, yet he makes exact same mistake himself thinking the Knights of the Vale were loyal to him. 

There's a reason Tywin was so furious about Tyrion being taken prisoner by Cat: ""If another House can seize one of our own and hold him with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared"". Littlefinger's demise was inevitable, because his wasn't a House to be feared.

There was no-one else in House Baelish, which meant there was no one to avenge him if someone killed him, which meant there was little to fear from killing him. Cersei could have had him killed in S1, with no fear it would provoke a rebellion. His own guards could just as easily have slit his throat to take his coinpurse, and who would've really cared? In the end it was Sansa who turned on him, and he was instantly exposed as no more powerful than Janos Slynt, being dragged off to the Wall bleating about how upset his 'friends in court' would be.",game of thrones

"[D] Despite the problematic derivative of the heaviside (step) function, why is it seemingly never used as an activation function? I'm a neuroscientist (slightly on the computational side; I use generalized linear models to model poisson spike data) and enjoy reading/learning about various machine learning topics. One thing that I've been unable to find an answer for is why, besides the problematic dirac derivative, the heaviside (step) function is almost never used these days. 

To me, the heaviside function has a nice neural interpretation: an action potential of a neuron. It either happens or it doesn't. Other activation functions could theoretically be thought of as the probability of firing, or perhaps rate of firing, but that's a less satisfying answer than I presume is buried out there in the literature. 

I understand current activation functions have nice derivatives that make the actual training of the model computational tractable. But is there any other reason to use things like ReLU and tanh that a heaviside (step) function itself cannot?

In other words, if you take a deep neural net and replace ReLU's and tanh's with the heaviside (step) function, would performance be similar (assuming you could efficiently train the heaviside (step) function version)? 

I hypothesize that you may need to add more neurons or layers to perhaps make up for some of the complexity ReLU's and tanh's confer. However, is there anything these nice activation functions do that heaviside itself cannot?

P.S. My search for multi-layer perceptrons have born little fruit, considering they too use ReLU's and tanh's.

For me:


1. I loved the scene when Cersei and Tyrion actually had a moment during their conversation before stannis came where she talked about if she wonders if this is price for loving jamie and how the targaryens got away with it. I wish there was one more after he joins with dany where they each show they a little hurt in how there on opposite sides of the war. (Their last conversation was good but not exactly the vibe I wanted) 


2. One more convo with Varys and little finger near the end when LF was about to scheme Arya ands Varys was starting to feel jon was the best. It would have been crazy if Varys said something along the lines of how is your grand plan going and LF said everything is on track, ands Varys responded something like mine too. It would have showed their power in the game, their two conflicting philosophies, ands get people into thinking what their master plans have been and are.

3. Dany and Cersei having a show down.

"[Spoilers] The end scene that should've been So my wife and I had finished binging for a 3rd time when she came up with a theory/end scene that would've saved the show; or at least lessen the bitter taste of season 8.

Okay, SPOILER starts here.

So at the end we got Dany going mad and killing everyone before eventually succumbing to the sweet embrace if eternity herself. Whether or not the going mad was warranted is a discussion long past so I'm not going to address that. We're gonna add this scene as if everything happened how it did.

So after the credits the black screen fades into a sheep running up a rocky incline. It stops every now and then to munch on grass, but immediately runs off when it's Shepard gets close (,who is revealed when the sheep moves a second time). The camera shows a wide shot of the sheep running to the top of this cliff and into what looks like a cave. The Shepard, who's clothes are ragged and old, hesitantly enters the cave as he wouldn't be able to afford another if he lost her. He creeps through the dark cavern and gets scared at the bellowing sound of a growl coming from around the corner. As scared as he was, he made his way around the corner to see a most terrifying sight: a giant living, breathing dragon. Larger than even the building his family calls home, the massive black creature raises it's massive head and looks directly at the man. Despite his terror, he is unable to leave so he observes his surroundings. Nestled on Drogon's body is the skeleton of a small woman, her platinum hair still laying atop it's skull. A bit further from the selection is a small pile of stones, all shaped the exact same: like a large scaly egg. Strangely, the dragon didn't incinerate him and turn him into the blackened charred corpses like the ones paying around him.

Why I loved her theory was because not only did it show Drogon still loved Dany, but it showed the dragons were not extinct/ going extinct when Drogon died. On top of that, it almost comes from circle from thousands of years ago when the Valaryians, who were all a simple Shepard community, first discovered dragons and their eggs and went on to conquer the known world/ build the most advanced city ever in existence. Perhaps this shepard was actually a decendant from a Valaryian and is now about to lead to the development of the here generation's Dragon Riders.

"Help Understanding the Power Function of a Test I need help understanding why this solution is correct..

Let X1, ..., Xn be iid Unif(0, theta). Let Y=max{X1, ..., Xn}. We wish to test H0: theta = 1/2 against HA : theta &gt; 1/2. Suppose we decide to reject the null when Y&gt;c for some value c. Find the power function.

The solution provided is that the power function is equal to 1-(2c)\^(n) and I am super confused. Here is how I approach the problem...

&amp;#x200B;

We say the power of a test is P(rejecting H0 | H0 is not true). So, for this problem, I express that as follows...

power(theta) = P(Y&gt;c | theta &gt; 1/2)

= 1 - P(Y&lt;c | theta &gt; 1/2)

= 1 - P(X1, ..., Xn &lt; c | theta &gt; 1/2)

= 1 - (c/theta)\^(n) where theta &gt; 1/2 (as the pdf f(x) for Unif(0,theta) is equal to x/theta)

"Trying to understand the PNP Formula Hi all,

With reference to the PNP paper and wiki:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective-n-Point

I completely get how this (https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44b08350499fdc91862c67cf8023fbbd606b26fb) system of equations is derived. But I have no idea how this eventually links back to the matched pixel coordinates, or how R and T are solved. 

Is there any resource that explains how the system of linear equations are actually setup to solve this?",data science
"[Spoilers] An Issue I have with the storyline in Season 8 of the TV Show So I was thinking about how angry Daenerys was about Jon being Aegon Targaryen and how she keeps saying how “peaceful” everything was “with a Targaryen on the iron throne”. I mean story wise - with her being batshit - it does makes sense. But even, the main characters, including Jon, should’ve realized she was just power-hungry and greedy and wanted to control everything herself. It had nothing to do with being a Targaryen or believing that she would bring peace to the world. Basically, they should’ve seen that she was a total tyrant - especially regarding the North wanting to be free from the 7 kingdoms.

It literally makes no logical sense to be mad about Jon being a Targaryen OR about the North being an “independent kingdom”.

1) If the North was an independent kingdom, Jon/Aegon Targaryen would be the King in the North. So a Targaryen would still be ruling the North.

2) Ignoring the issues with the North wanting to be independent (and this particular point has bothered them hell out of me since it first aired), Jon says multiple times: “I don’t want it”, “You are my Queen”, “I will refuse the throne”. Daenerys argues by saying that even if Jon were to refuse the throne, people would *make* him take it. That he’d have no choice in the matter. Which is bullshit —and Jon of all people should’ve known this and pointed it out: 

Aemon Targaryen was meant to be King, also. He did not want it. He did not feel he was suited to rule. So he refused the throne. He took the black and went to the wall, he then became a master and served at Castle Black until he died. Leaving the throne to his brother.

If her argument made sense, Aemon would not have been able to do that. He would’ve been made to take the throne regardless. All Jon had to do was tell her about Aemon. 

<Like, how many times does she say that she’s the last Targaryen. And she says it TO Jon, like, why is no one telling her about Aemon?>

Just wanted to see what your guys thoughts on these ideas are. 

Thanks! :)",game of thrones

"Need help with deep reinforcement learning implementation I've been attempting to get an implementation of deep reinforcement learning using the game Catch to work for several months now, but no matter what I try, the same thing always happens, even after thousands of episodes. The agent simply chooses a random action at the beginning of the game and then repeats it forever. Most of the time it picks the action that stands for moving to the right and then gets itself stuck in the right corner of the screen (though sometimes it also gets stuck in place in the middle of the screen). It never even attempts to catch any of the balls falling down, it just stays in the corner forever. The game itself is as simple as it can be. It's just 84 by 84 pixels, the balls are single white pixels and the plate the agent controls to catch them with is 3 white pixels at the very bottom of the screen. The neural net behind the agent consists of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. For the neural networks I am using a library I coded up in Java over the course of a year that does not depend on any external libraries/dependencies except for JOCL (Java OpenCL bindings). I have tested all my implementations there extensively, and everything checks out, so the issue is somewhere in my reinforcement learning implementation, which is actually quite short (I can post some heavily commented code if anyone wants me to). As I said, it's been months, I've tested everything and so far it looks like I've done everything correctly. I mean, I literally copied code from a working example I found online and it still doesn't work.

&gt; An interesting technique that is frequently used in dynamical supervised learning tasks (Jordan, 1986; Pineda, 1988) is to replace the actual output *yk(t)* of a unit by the teacher signal *dk(t)* **in subsequent computation** of the behavior of the network, whenever such a value exists. We call this technique teacher forcing. (bold added)

In this paper *yk(t)* is the output of the network (predicted value) at time t per the paragraph after eq. 3, and *dk(t)* is the target at time t (so the ground truth or observed data).

I am trying to predict in a time series the t+1 observed value with the sequence *t-5,..., t*. The way my problem is set, I have a sequence of size 5 to predict the ""next"" element. The observed value at *t* would be already be the target value *dk(t)*, so how can it be that I should ""replace the actual output *yk(t)* of a unit by the teacher signal *dk(t)* **in subsequent computation**""?

I am working on a manuscript for a study looking at the habitat characteristics of 2 sympatric cottontail species.  One of the species is of conservation concern, while the other is a non-native species.  The initial goal of the project was to identify any fine-scale habitat characteristics that seem to be preferred by the native cottontail over the non-native cottontail so that landowners can manage their land specifically for the native cottontail.  I collected continuous data on 6 habitat variables at sites occupied by either the non-native, or native cottontail (non-native n=19, native n=17….should they be equal??)
It has been a long time since I have dealt with the data, since the data is now 3 years old, and my paper has gone through many rounds of edits.  The first analysis I did was a univariate logistic regression to find out which variables were statistically significant, then put those in a multivariate logistic regression to choose a model. 
I don't know if this analysis is appropriate or not, or if there is perhaps a better way to approach this, so I am looking for input.

"Estimating Covid-19 Infections based on Reported Deaths Since the number of test varies significantly between individual countries, and no country is is even close to reaching 100% test coverage, the reported infections have to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt. However, reported deaths should be much more accurate, since everybody who dies as a consequence of a covid infection pretty much has to be ""in the system"".

So I tried to find a way to ""backtrack"" actual infection numbers based on reported deaths and some other parameters. The calculation could look something like this:

**Assumptions**

* Number of infections is doubling every 3 days
* It takes on average 12 days from infection to death
* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

**Calclulation**

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&amp;#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

"Simultaneously fitting two functions Hello,

Cross posted to /r/machinelearning.

I'm looking for a bit of insight on how to simultaneously fit two functions to experimental data.  My general approach is to define a suitable cost function (least squares) and then minimize that cost function by iteratively adjusting model parameters (using gradient decent).  This approach was developed by Andrew Ng in his [Machine Learning](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=MachineLearning) course to fit one function to a set of data.  I would like to make sure that I'm correctly generalizing this approach to simultaneously fit two functions.  

Sorry for hand writing most of the content.....hope it is readable.

[Link to Solution Description](http://imgur.com/a/3nbMF)

My questions:

* Is there a better way to define the cost function for fitting two equations?

* Is it necessary to use feature scaling to keep the order of Y-residual and Z-residual terms comparable in size.  Example: I would imagine some scaling must be required if (lets say) Y data is all on the order of 1 and Z data is all on the order of 100. 

* What is the most simple (or most correct) way to implement feature scaling for this type of problem?

This is the first time I've tried to regress a more complex system.  I'm excited because the approach seems very general (i.e., define a suitable cost function and minimize that cost function using gradient decent).  Any insight, tips, or tricks Reddit has for me are greatly appreciated!!!

Thanks in advance for the help!

I often wish we could see into an alternate dimension where GRRM decided to keep this storyline alive and more prominent, even if it meant sacrificing a different character and story. 

Imo, Rob and Talisa had the best chemistry of any couple on the show, not to mention Oona Chaplin was the most drop dead gorgeous girl in the entire cast. I know, love is the death of duty, and you don’t get a wife like that, get to be king AND expect a long, happy ending. But these characters were so perfect and deserved so much more.

Obviously the Red Wedding was the climax to this  heartbreaking story, but even the build up in the episodes previous, Rob’s army unraveling, strategies failing, pressure building against him. You can see the writing is on the wall, but the love they share keeps him strong and perhaps blind to this fact, making it all the more beautiful and tragic. Yes I’m a hopeless romantic.

"How do Pixel RNN's Row LSTMs work? This is related to the Pixel RNNs paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf)

The Row LSTMs don't seem very clear to me. I think I understand how the state-to-state component is computed - take the previous hidden state and convolve with K\_ss.

However the input-to-state is extremely confusing. The authors say we must take the row x\_i from the input when computing h\_i and c\_i, but I just can't seem to understand this. Mainly, how can we use x\_i as input when that's what you're learning to predict?

To add to the confusion is Figure 4. Over there it shows that the input-to-state for the row LSTM is the previously generated pixel (one to the left of the current pixel). I also watched a video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FFveGrG46w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FFveGrG46w)) where they say the input-to-state when predicting/learning for a row is a 1-D convolution of that row from the original image. Isn't that wrong? Or am I just massively confused?

In all, I just need help understanding what exactly is the input-to-state and state-to-state for the Row LSTM. Thanks in advance!",data science

"In what industry are data scientists “second class citizens” ? In what industry would you say data scientists considered “in the shadows” of other positions? For example, in tech; software engineers are closer to the product, and hence get paid more than data scientists (this is what I read on the why not FAANG post). So my question is, are there industries in which data scientists play more of a central role? For some that come to mind I think of maybe biotech, or government, or financial services, but the pay isn’t like tech in these spaces, so I guess that’s the trade off. But any other industries where data scientists are more if the driver of business? Or closer to money?",data science
"Recommendation for UK data science aspirants Hi all, I noticed something of a trend of people here unable to break into the industry. I thought I'd share a recommendation for those based in the UK: apply for a degree apprenticeship in Data Science. You'll get a salary, a qualification, and a solid chunk of marketable experience.

There are many going, in various companies, including some big names. They don't have heavy entry requirements, just A-Levels or something to that extent. Even if you can't find any degree apprenticeship vacancies, you can go to the Institute for Apprentices website, and supply the information on it to a company of interest. You might be able to persuade them to take you on as a degree apprentice. Be persistent, network like a madman, and you will likely find a few companies who are at least happy to discuss possibilities. Lots of adults even up to mid thirties do these programmes, and the programmes are becoming more and more popular with employers.

Some fairly obvious issues: many of you have Bachelor's or even Master's already. You can do degree apprenticeships to a Master's level as well as Bachelor's. These apprenticeships are very practical and assess you based off your work projects. It will definitely be a different experience to typical academia, so there's no redundancy, just a smaller salary than you'd get as a junior data scientist, though it depends entirely on the company. You get 20% of your work time to put towards the degree, so if you already know a lot of the content you can spend it developing your own data science skills while still getting paid.

So, that's what a degree apprenticeship is, but why should you do it?
It instantly places you into the industry, into hands-on, relevant, applied experience for a prestigious company. No company wants an apprentice to sit around watching the experts do all the work without contribution. You'll get put to work as soon as you demonstrate the ability to do so and you'll be working alongside the junior data scientists, often as equals, and mentored by senior data scientists along the way. You'll have a bustling CV at the end of your first year, and if you finish the programme, the company, in all probability will take you on as an employee afterwards.


I can say with confidence if you are up to the task, you will leave with as much experience as a junior data scientist having undergone the same number of years as you did for the programme. 


I realize I've focused very much on the positive here. Obviously it's not an amazing salary and pays about 20k-23k annually, a lot lower than many data science roles. You also can't get promoted during the programme (though salary bumps are possible). Feel free to PM me for more information too.",data science

Spider's Stupidity: He started failing his pursuasion/deception rolls.

Daenerys: Failed a wisdom saving throw which is why she burnt things down.

Briane and Jaime: Combination of passed and failed charm/seduction rolls ending in a failed persuasion roll.

Bear Fucker: forgot his real name, but failed all seduction throws as most of his character points would be put into his strength/dexterity 

Finally, the new leader would totally be explained through persuasion checks.

I've talked to him in the past about Machine Learning and he seems to have these ideas of throwing everything at it or parsing out specific parts of the data and then throwing that in a bucket with some magic and getting answers.

From my understanding (and small amount of experience) we take the data, normalize it, cut it up into pieces to build a model, train the model, and most importantly have a clear, direct, and simple question to ask of our data. 

Are there any simple and insightful resources out there for showing the extreme basics of machine learning? I've tried looking but everything I've seen jumps right into frameworks and tools. 

For instance, I remember an article that was parsing user feedback (text and a score they picked) and trying to predict the score based of text to the feedback. It went through parsing the data, normalizing, creating a bag of words, a model, training the model, and then further methods. I can't find the article now (of course) but it illustrated the ""simple questions"" aspect I am trying to drive home.

"[SPOILERS] Do you think Daenerys was truly evil? This is, perhaps, a silly question that has been discussed from time to time, but I had this debate with a few friends lately and was pleasantly surprised at how polarizing the debate was. Half of my friend group believed Dany was not truly evil. She simply was a good, well-intended person with very questionable tactics towards the end of her life and fell victim to circumstance. The other half believed Dany was evil, that she was a villian who never actually had any good intentions and was arguably the most self-serving character on the show. I took the side of the latter half. This will be a somewhat long post, but I will be making my case here.

My pro-Dany friends argued that she couldn't possibly have been a villain because she was well-meaning and did so many good deeds in her pursuit to the Iron Throne. However, I don't think this argument is entirely valid. Human history is FILLED with evil people who genuinely believed they were right. Very few evil people actually see themselves as evil. Intentions alone are not enough to justify a person's gruesome actions. When you publicly execute the innocent along with the guilty parties, burn people alive for not ""bending the knee"", and completely burn a city to ash in a blind rage of fire, you are evil.

Also let's examine a lot of these good deeds that Dany carried out in her pursuit to Westoros. She claimed she was doing all these things for the sake of creating a better world and for the prosperity of the people. She VERY rarely (if at all) did anything in the entire story that was not for her own personal gain.

""She freed the slaves"" and made sure to constantly remind them of who it was that freed them to ensure their undying fidelity.

""She overthrew tyrants."" Yes and these tyrants conveniently happened to be ruling over a city that she wanted to rule for herself. A lot of her evil nature was masked or overlooked because, at the time, the actions of those she was killing were worse than her own.

She constantly touted that she wanted to ""break the wheel"" and create a better world but could not fathom the mere possibility that this could happen without her being the ruler. She didnt want to BE good, otherwise she would have at least considered the possibility of this better world being created without her being at the top. She wanted to APPEAR good and be revered as the selfless, benevolent ""breaker of chains""

Her goals were always to seize the throne and be adored by her subjects. Sure she seemed to be gentler than many other monarchs depicted in the show, She showed kindness when she knew it wouldn't make her life harder, and seemed somewhat capable of compassion, but never if it even slightly interfered with the power she sought. 

Remember when Jon Snow's true parentage was revealed? She knew that he would be a great ruler because he was selfless, a proven leader, and trusted by the Northerners, but she could not tolerate any future in which she was not the one sitting on the throne. The possibility of a ""better world"" being completely feasible with a different ruler was not something she would stand for. She didn't welcome the potentially prosperous reign that Jon could have; she simply saw him as a threat because it was entirely possible the people of Westoros would prefer his rule to hers. 

Samwell Tarly's line to Jon perfectly encapsulates this concept: ""You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same""

Daenarys also displays a LOT of narcissism in that she seemed to genuinely believe she is some omnipotent entity that is the singular judge of what is good for the world. Before the march on King's Landing, Jon finally saw (or perhaps just stopped ignoring) the fact that her lust for power was far greater than her desire to create a better world. He believed that the people of the Seven Kingdoms could be entrusted to decide what is good and what is not. Dany immediately dismissed this idea and said very plainly ""They don't get to choose.""

In conclusion, yes, Daenerys Targaryen is evil.",game of thrones

...Arya tasked Jaqen to assassinate Tywin but she became the servant of the Mountain?

My initial research led me into the direction of NLP but I suspect that this is not quite the right tool/an overkill, given that the information is usually contained in a unstructured list rather than a complete sentence.

"[SPOILERS] Prince Who Was Promised Theory Okay so, I have a theory about who the Prince Who Was Promised (PWWP)/ Azor Ahai (AA) is in ASOIAF. I did some light research about this theory online but not too much, and opinions/thoughts are welcome to either dispute/support this theory but basically; the PWWP/AA is not Jon Snow/Aegon Targ., but Drogon. Yea, the dragon. I came to this idea because: 

 1) the entire ‘the dragon must have 3 heads’ prophecy; Daenerys gave birth to literally 3 dragons, one of which is Drogon.  

2) the PWWP will wield a sword of fire—Drogon (and all dragons in the series afaik) uses fire as his weapon (or, ‘sword’).  

3) the Dosh Khaleen told Daenerys that her son would be Azor Ahai, the Stallion who would Mount the world—Drogon is Daenerys’ son and he could be interpreted as a stallion since Dany does ride him into battle/in general. 

During the series, other names such as the ‘Son of fire’ can be used to describe the PWWP—Drogon was given life during a fire. I know the PWWP is supposed to pull a sword, named Lightbringer, from flames and use it to save the world, and I am not sure how that incorporates into the theory here, but Drogon is the one to “save” the world from the Iron Throne, as he melts it.  ",game of thrones

"[SPOILERS] Minor detail that may prove that Bran was misleading everyone (including the audience) When appeared in visions he was always wearing the outfit from the real world. The only exception was during the ""Aegon Targaryen reveal"". He was wearing the same outfit as before (in S6), when he discovered the identity of Jon's mother.

Therefore, it seems to me that Bran learned Jon's true identity months before discussed it with Sam.",game of thrones

"Looking for advice on how to set up parameters for CNN (sequential) Hello! 

Is there any guide I can follow to help set up a CNN, using a sequential method? I have a dataset of over 100,000 images from Kaggle and am looking to categorize them into 25 different groups. 

I understand I need to add Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers. But I'm unsure of how many to put and what parameters to set them at. I understand that I will have to do trial and error until I get the accuracy high but right now I am getting an accuracy of 0%. I found the following code snippet online which works for a 10 category classification and I'm trying to see how this would be changed to go to 25 groups. Any help or advice on where to look would be appreciated! Thanks

"Concurrent work on a single dataset, multiple team members I am facing a seemingly simple workflow issue and I'm almost certain that my current method for handling it is sub-optimal.

I have a single dataset comprising a few thousand rows and maybe 50 columns that is still being built-out, updated, and transformed daily as requirements evolve. Our workflow at the moment includes working with the file in Excel one-at-time and keeping track of who is currently editing via Slack alerts from our ELK stack (checking who downloaded/uploaded it from an internal filehost). The 5 analysts involved all have tools of their choice (with some knowing Python or R) but excel is of course the lowest-common denominator.

Is there a better way for the team to work on the data concurrently? Google sheets is not an option, though the dataset will eventually be ETL'd into a MySQL table. I'm wondering if getting it into SQL now would increase or decrease productivity, because many of the tasks at the moment are tantamount to data entry, and I'm not sure how easy it would be to handle this simple row-level updates with the data in an RDBMS.",data science

"Where is the field going [D] I have some thoughts I would like to share.

Machine  learning is about fitting a function to data in order to predict its  value for unseen input. There are many functions that can fit given  data. The one we want is the one that can generalise best. We can  evaluate generalisation ability to some extent on test data. However,  the true function we fundamentally cannot know. It could be any one of  many functions that fit the data we've got, both train and test.

The  vision of the machine learning community is developing learning  algorithms that can generalise well from data to unseen examples. I'm  questioning whether what we're trying to achieve is fundamentally  possible, and I don't see how it could be.

Of  course you can extend Occam's razor and say the true function will be  the smoothest. And I believe much success can be attributed to the fact  you can make this extension in some cases. So is learning the best  smooth function the holy grail and that's what we're working on  perfecting? How are we ever going to tackle general problems i.e. ones  where we don't assume Occam's razor?",data science

He of course would set parameters and canon, but allow other authors to come in and tell stories of events from the history of the world or even what was going on in other places as the events of the novels were taking place and, lets say, word of those events reached distant lands and how various people or nations reacted to them or how things in Westeros affected OTHER parts of Westeros that weren't related in the books.

Wild CARDS work extremely well as a shared universe and I think the abilities and voices of other authors would do well to flesh out so many aspects of the ASOIAF world.",game of thrones
"Can/Should you get a M1 for CS degree So I’ll be off to college oversea soon, I still have another year of highschool (foundation course you could say). And I’m looking for a Laptop to support me through University.
First of all, I’m not gonna lie, I am an Apple fan, I own many Apple products (Macs not included) so Mac comes to my mind first. I currently have a window PC at home and it still works fine for regular school work and also light-medium gaming. However I’ve been looking to purchase a laptop for a while, specifically a Macbook.
I decided to aproach for a CS degree cause I think this is the major I want to study.
The reason I want to buy a Macbook are :
-	Great performance and efficiency for the price and also for a laptop ( I believe )
-	Long term use, I see most Mac user don’t tend to upgrade their Macs for at least 5 years.
-	Design wise, I really love Macbooks design cause not only they have the aesthetics but also very lightweight, flexible for on the go.
-	Amazing battery without losing any performance.
-	MacOS fluidity + Ecosystem flexibility
I know that Macs are actually aren’t cheap and people are saying that you could get more for a Windows laptop/PC for that kind of price however what I care for the most is not only the performance but also for LONG TERM USAGE. I’ll be happy to pay a hefty price for Mac if it will last me for a VERY VERY LONG TIME and also support me when I get a job or sth, preferably over 6-7 years.
From where I’m coming from (South East Asia ), some of my seniors are saying that I should get Windows instead cause’ there are tools that are only available and more optimized for Windows instead of MacOS. I also asked them if VMs can solve the problem but they still said no cause there are strict rules + programs that require native Windows such as Matlab, Code Dev C++, EOS,…( these are only some that I heard off smh )
Whereas my sources from Youtube and other platforms are saying that Mac are basically the best option for CS degree and also for futures Devs. And genuinely speaking, I could not decide which one to pick.
Of course there are other alternatives which are Intel-based Macs since not only it can run MacOS and Windows natively but also Linux too. Intel-based 15-16” also have a dedicated GPU which can also run AAA games. I mean these are great options as well but after doing some research, I found that some people with high-end Intel Macs are complaining about how Apple is slowly dropping support for these machines, not giving them great performances and constantly removing features that are on the M1s which really stressing me out somehow. Not to mention Intel Macs are still somewhat so damn expensive, again, from where I’m from, Intel Macs and M1s are only a 100 dollars difference. Which make me debate whether I should get more performance or more versatility 😭😭😭
Thank you all to whoever have read through this far! I’m also very happy to acknowledge new informations and advices too! I want a Mac but if it doesn’t help me with my studies then i could also might get a Windows Ultrabook.
P/s : I’m debating between M1 13” Macbook Pro 16/256 and a base 14”",data science

"Interview for Director of Marketing Analytics and I have a couple questions about data lakes Hey, I'm a fairly seasoned technical marketer with about 10 years of experience. I know SQL, python, built some ETL pipelines (using a 3rd party tool) etc, but I don't have extensive experience on the data *engineering* side of things. 

This new role I'm up for mentioned a couple things I'm unfamiliar with, in particular that a consultant has set up a ""data lake"" that they're very pleased with.

Reading up on it has me confused on benefits and how a data lake differs in practice. Is it just a database of unrelated tables without keys or explicitly configured relationships? What exactly does a data lake look like compared to the relational database model I'm used to? For example, how do SELECT and JOIN differ? Or is there some sort of abstraction layer sitting in between?  

And, frankly, for a fairly typical marketing analytics role that involves no machine learning or anything too fancy, it would seem that a data lake is more or less something that should constantly be evolving into a traditional relational database, right? If not, aren't they basically doing on the fly ETLs... And incurring a massive performance hit? 

They mentioned they're paying for Panoply, but didn't say if it's involved in this use case.

"Comment Personally, i really hate the way the show tried to condense storylines that could have filled 2 full more seasons into 2 shorter seasons.

The Dany turn is extremely weird to me though. They have the perfect setup: Dany hates Cersei with all her heart and doesn't want her to live, even when the city surrenders. Very fair with what has happened. Cersei knows that Dany is a liberator and as a precausion, publicly announces that she is inviting hundreds of normal people, women and children included, into the Red Keep.

So why doesn't Dany go after the Red Keep in her hatred? Killing Cersei is the main goal, not slaughtering Kings Landing. She looks at the Red Keep, launches toward it and then just turns away and burns everyone BUT Cersei. Maybe i am missing something obvious, but imo, Dany should have gone for the Red Keep and burned it in its entirety. You'd still have Dany commiting all the war crimes, you'd still have a large obstacle for Jons morals to come to terms with, and the ""turn"" would make much more sense.

It was set up perfectly, and then goes completely off the rails. Really weird to me.",game of thrones

"Sample size vs rms Hi,

I frequently work on imaging chips sometimes we calculate their properties, say read noise. The common procedure is to take repeated images, calculate pixel-wise RMS of the images, then obtain the mean of RMS image.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, series of events lead me to check the dependency of rms with respect to sample size. I did an experiment in python like this:

`from numpy import mean, arange, sqrt, median`

`from numpy.random import randn`

`sigma = 10.`

`ims = sigma*randn(800, 800, 100)`

`print ""%10s %10s %10s %10s %10s %10s"" % (""#Images"", ""RMS"", ""Diff %"", ""Std"", ""Diff %"", ""&lt;x&gt;^2"")`

`for i in arange(3,100):`

`a = mean(ims[:,:,:i]**2, axis=2)`

`b = mean(ims[:,:,:i], axis=2)**2`

`c = sqrt(a-b)`

`rms = mean(c)`

`std = mean(c)*sqrt(i)/sqrt(i-1)`

`print ""%10d %10.2f %10.2f %10.2f %10.2f %10.2f"" % (i, rms, (1.-rms/10.)*100, std, (1-std/10.)*100, mean(b))`

In the end, I obtain;

   `#Images        RMS     Diff %        Std     Diff %      &lt;x&gt;^2`

To be honest, I didn't expect that big of a difference. Our usual go to is RMS in this case. I can understand the benefit of giving a degree of freedom since we dont necessarily know the mean. But, as you see it still can't explain 10% difference with sample of 3.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't expect numpy random generator to be perfect. But, I am consistently getting very similar results when I run the code. So, I dont think random generator is the main issue here. This is really bothering me. I would appreciate if someone can explain what is going on here.

"Clinical Drugs Trials are becoming inaccessible and underpowered - could Bayesian adaptive platform trials change the game? https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/could-a-new-business-model-make-clinical-drug-trials-more-accessible-to-patients

&gt;Stern: Frequentist trials are those that basically set everything up in advance, and in a sense let it run, let it rip. Traditional randomized controlled trials are frequentist trials. We do some statistical calculations up front, and we say, ""Look, if we're expecting this type of effect from this drug, this is roughly how many patients we'll need to give it to, in order to observe a statistically significant difference between treatments and control groups.""

&gt;Bayesian trials, which are the basis for adaptive platform trials, are a little bit different. What Bayesian trials do is incorporate information as it accumulates. I'll give you an example. Say patients with a certain tumor type are doing incredibly well on a given therapy. We can incorporate that information into how we assign patients to receive that therapy, and that'll work into the adaptive platform design.

*****

&gt;What the platform trial does builds on this insight that if we can get it together in advance to coordinate on a lot of aspects of the trial infrastructure, we can actually share a control arm...Now, without doing anything else, we have just gone from needing 160 patients in total for us both to get statistical significance, to needing 120 patients. The sample size has decreased. We're seeing efficiencies, especially in uncommon cancer where it's often hard to find these patients; 40 percent of cancer trials never fully enroll.

*****

&gt;Then, we can layer on top of that setup what we call Bayesian adaptive randomization....We can use our pre-specified algorithm to now preferentially assign that type of patient to your arm of the trial. Patients love this. As the trial progresses, patients are not only being used efficiently, because of the shared control arm component of the trial design, but we've also got the patients that are coming in being preferentially assigned to the treatment arm of the trial they're most likely to benefit from.",data science

"[Spoilers] S8 Tyrion and Theon I mostly disliked S8 but there’s some small gems of genius in S8. How they compare Tyrion’s and Theon’s character journeys are perfect examples of this. When the two meet Tyrion is a man who knows who he is. He might hate Cersei, Joffrey, and Tywin. But he’s a member of the family and goes to incredible lengths for his family. He has no other family or loyalty. This only changes as the former three plot against him. Theon on the other hand has two families, he struggles with his loyalty, has an identity crisis between being Stark and Ironborn, and does horrible things as a result later on. This (and an insane amount of abuse) also contributes to his transformation into Reek and furthers his identity crisis as he believes that it’s too late change and that he deserves whats happened to him. 

Throughout the story, we see these two characters slowly change positions  mentally until it comes to a head with the completion of their arcs in S8. Theon’s story ends with him, his sister, and the Starks having accepted that he is both Ironborn and Stark. He dies fighting to save them both. Meanwhile at the same time, Tyrion is struggling with his loyalty to his Queen, his family, and friends who are quickly losing faith in Dany. He’s no longer sure of his loyalty and is conflicted.

And pls don’t say it’s fine cus it’s hot, can we look at it from a mature viewpoint? It can be hot but it’s still wrong that they rely on sexualising them so much more than they do men. Like it’s not hiding that they’re appealing to the male gaze a lot of the time

"[Discussion] What is the purpose of noise in a Conditional GAN? I just implemented a [cGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) for generating MNIST data where I concatenated the noise (z) and the one-hot labels (y) as the input to the Generator.The results looked really promising within a few epochs and results were almost realistic within a 100 epochs.

Then after a bit of free flowing thought I wondered if removing the noise (z) entirely and only have the one-hot labels (y) as the input would convert the problem to supervised learning and I would have fast convergence and great looking results. However when I implemented this, the results looked promising for 5 epochs but then took a wrong turn and the results looked nothing like the MNIST data.

I understand that this defeats the purpose of the paper itself which tries alternatives to the one-to-one mapping of supervised learning.
&gt; A second issue is that much of the work to date has focused on learning one-to-one mappings from input to output. However, many interesting problems are more naturally thought of as a probabilistic one-to-many mapping.

But assuming that I don't mind having a one-to-one mapping, why doesn't conditioning the generator on only the labels (y) as input produce good results? What is the purpose of the noise (z)?

Note: In case you have a complaint that the way I concatenated the noise and labels initially was not part of the original architecture of the paper, here's an interesting discussion from a few days ago about something similar. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6je46u/d_about_conditional_gan_when_to_concatenate/)

>  
>Arya: I'm not going to poison an innocent woman.  
>  
>Jaqen: The Many Faced God has many poisons.  Some which kill the body, some which kill the mind, some which kill only the face.  Or the one to whom it belongs.  
>  
>Arya: Lady Crane is a faceless one?  
>  
>Jaqen: In a way.  
>  
>Arya: But, all of the faces in the Hall belonged to people who are already dead.  
>  
>Jaqen: So they do.  
>  
>Arya: Why would we need to kill the person whose face she's wearing?  
>  
>Jaqen: And whose face does she wear?  
>  
>Arya: I... don't know.  If she's not an actor, who is she?  
>  
>Jaqen: She is an actor.  One who puts on the face of another every day.  As all actors do.  
>  
>Arya: So she pretends to be someone else.  That's not a reason to kill her.  
>  
>Jaqen: *(pause, turning away)* The poison would not have killed her, for she had no knowledge of what she was doing.  It would only have killed the one whose face she wore, the woman kneeling over her murdered son.  
>  
>*(Arya's eyes widen, she realizes what he means.)*  
>  
>Jaqen: The Many Faced God has given a girl a chance to cross a name off her list.  But a girl has failed.  And now a debt is owed.

In other words, >!the poison Jaqen gave to Arya to kill Lady Crane would actually have killed the person she was portraying in the play:!< >!Cersei Lannister.!< >!The entire assassination attempt was both a test and a lesson. Jaqen's claim that ""a price was paid"", and Arya's deduction that this was nothing more than a sell-sword hit was a red herring. It was a test of Arya's devotion to MFG, and a lesson that as long as she followed her orders, no matter how unethical those orders might seem, he would never ""ask any service of her that would bring her dishonor.""!<

"I’m a Medical Doctor and Data Scientist in search for a job offer in the US or EU Hello all! I’m a MD and DS based in Curitiba-BR. I have around 2 yrs of experience working on DS for health (mostly ML on medical imagery and time series analysis/predictions) and I’ve been trying to send my CV to some US/EU based enterprises - all health techs - on job positions they’d be offering, but got rejected by all (5 enterprises).

"[Spoilers] finished season six, here are my thoughts I've only two seasons left and I'm excited although I heard the finale was disappointing and had something to do with a dragon.

 I didn't except Jon to come back, we've only had 1 fake out death and the character wasn't even major (leader of the brothers without banners) When an important character was dying like Robb who was less injured then Jon they didn't survive so to see him come back was a great surprise. 

Cersi continues to manipulate Tommen and it's crazy how she can't see how it's wrong. Her redeeming quality is supposed to be how she loves her children but she doesn't.

Cersi keeps talking for Tommen and it gets more and more annoying Everytime. I was starting to like Jamie but because she's in cersi's pocket I'm starting not to like him. 

I hate the religious fanatics but I love that they're hurting the Lannisters (really just Cersi)

When will the Lannisters go after Dorne? Cersi won't let them get away with her daughters murder. 

Summer just died leaving only 2 dire wolves, Ghost and Arya's that ran off in the first season. 

The dead running through the tunnel is probably the coolest scene so far 

 I liked hodor, hoped he'd be one of the few to actually make it. 

Bran us responsible for Hodors disability, I wonder what he'll say about it

The dothraki coming up on the harpy's was an awesome sight

I hope to God that Jon doesn't lose to the Boltons. They've won twice already (against theon and Stannis) and I hope they won't win a third. 

Will Jon and Ramsay fight 1v1 and who will win if they do?

I would love to see Ramsay and tormund fight at least verbally, compare their brutality and insanity

I feel like someone on the stark team will die, I think it's between Davos, Tormund, and Rickon. Maybe sansa but I think the rest are more likely

tormund is awesome (apart from all the raping, murdering, and every other crime) I think they're showing us how cool is he is because he's going to die. But at the same time Davos us walking away from camp, maybe he'll get killed while on his walk. 

Sometimes we get a hint at what'll happen, I don't think there was one this time

Why hasn't the red woman tried to fuck Jon again to make another demon shadow to kill Ramsay? Jon has kings blood in him like Stannis and the blacksmith they were going to kill. 

I wonder if Tyrion will die at all and if so how will he go out?

Holy shit, the Bolton army is huge, Jon doesn't stand a chance. I really hope this won't be the slaughter it looks like it'll be. Who will help Jon last second, will it be the River run forces with Brienne and pod? Maybe Sansas cousin will send his forces, whoever comes to help I hope they do it quickly

Rickon is about to be killed by Ramsay's dogs, he'll run and they'll chase (Ramsay was just handed a bow so nevermind)

 The first stark child falls, who will be next?

Jon reminds me of captain America, standing against impossible odds but still not giving up

Jon fighting on the front line vs Ramsay hiding behind his men really shows the difference in their leadership

I would love to see Ramsay received similar torture to what he did to theon, he deserves worse but I don't see Jon doing it, maybe sansa will

I hated Cersi and wanted to see her die more than anything but now I'm hoping the faith will be slaughtered for their manipulation 

All of cersi's children are dead, will the starks meet the same fate?

Daenerys says she wants to rule the seven kingdoms, does that mean she wants to sit on the iron throne only or that she wants to rule all of westros? I hope that she doesn't go to war with the starks. 

I don't think Cersei knew Tommen would kill himself otherwise why have the mountain prevent him from going to the trial but things have worked out in her favor almost like she planned for it all

So far the starks have stayed my favorite, I wish we had more time with Rickon, we've come to know every stark child except for him and now we never will

When I finish season 8 I'll leave a ranking of my favorite characters throughout the whole series.",game of thrones

"[SPOILERS] Elia Martell 
I apologise if this has already been discussed.
Someone please refute or agree . 

1) In the  TV series it says that Rhaegar requested for annulment from Elia Martell.  Not divorce.  The books haven't covered this yet. 

2)There is also a line in A clash of kings where Varys is talking to Tyrion and says that apparently Elia cried out someone's name ( most probably someone in King's Landing who could save her ) when Gregor Clegane came with his men to kill her.  

These may not be connected at all

"Comment The reason why the first few seasons were done so well was because they had the books to draw inspiration, plotlines, dialogue from, they didn't have that for the last few seasons. 

I think I remember hearing that GRRM had basically given them the end points for each character, and pretty much left them to devise how each character gets to those points. 

There are characters still alive in the books, that were killed off in the show. There are characters that were never introduced into the show, that are important to the books outcome. There are plotlines that were disregarded in the show, that has impact on how the story evolves. The book may end in a similar way, but what happens along the way can drastically change how we feel about the conclusion.

As for whether the books come out at all, that's definitely a major fear.",game of thrones

"Question about gated recurrent units and MLPs Hello everyone,

Question about a personal machine learning project that I'm working on: I'm currently working with features extracted from a CNN (which learned to correctly classify images). Now my goal is to use those feature vectors and re-learn to cluster them according to a (ground-truth) distance matrix. I have successfully done so with a simple MLP that uses a simple mean squared error loss (which tries to minimize distances between the learned features and those of the ground-truth distance matrix - a simple regression task that tries to emulate the distance matrix). My question is the following: Would it be appropriate to use something like a GRU (for instance) instead, to work on this task?

I understand that GRUs are usually used with sequence data, but in my case, they seem to work slightly better than MLPs (when it comes to making predictions) and I'm not sure why. Is that reasonable at all, or are there more appropriate methods that can be used to learn distances between feature vectors?

Not a computer scientist, so would appreciate any advice!

Thanks in advance!",data science

"[Career Help] From Engineering to Data Science  Hello guys!  
I'm a 24 yrs old Industrial Engineering student ( 9th semester out of 10 ) in Rio, Brazil.  
Throughout all my academic life, I've studied MS excel, VBA, then Power BI with some programming.  
During  the year of 2018, I took part in a business consulting project ( that  mainly focused on processes optimization, marketing, business identity,  etc ) where I stepped up because of  critical thinking and analytical  skills, which made me really proud of myself. I was able redesign lots  of processes and helped some other members develop these skills.  
Once I was done with the project I began researching for an internship program.  
On  May of 2019, I was very fortunate to start a Industrial Engineering  internship on Michelin, one of the most respected tires industries out  there. And once again I was recognized for good analytical skills,  agility with numbers and was learning stuff really quick.  
However,  after a couple months I realized Industrial engineering was more about  being able to find physical solutions to processes based on analytical  data then analyzing data for the sole purpose of getting new insights.  And I've never been interested in tools, machines, manufacturing and  such, only data and analysis. Because of that, I dropped off to focus on  what interested me more: anything more related to analytics.

**TL;DR:** *Just  left an internship program in Industrial Engineering because I feel  like I should give a shot to analytics, and would like to get to know  better about my opportunities to learn and develop skills*.

After  I left the job, I strumbled upon some key words: Big data, Machine  learning, Cloud computing, Python, Ansible, Jenkins, and been into a  hard time trying to figure it all by myself. Even started a python and  data engineer courses.

I woud like  some tips on what to figure out first, some good professionals/ content  creators I could follow on social media, and **most importantly**,  whats the big picture of it all? How all these pieces fit together?  What's the ways from servers' infrastrutcture to data scientists?

"[Spoilers] I actually think the ending was the best ending there could have been The first time I watched the ending my reaction was just ""why"", and after re-watching the entire show I actually think the ending was the best ending there could have been.

&#x200B;

If Daenerys didn't go mad, she would either win the throne or somehow lose to Cersei, but in either case nothing would change and there would be no point to the show. The entire show would basically be a glimpse of a random timeline in Westeros, in which this king ruled and then that king tried to take the throne, but the ""game of thrones"" would never stop.

&#x200B;

Instead, from the beginning of the show we got to see enough reference history to understand what was Westeros like, and in the ending we witnessed the biggest and most dramatic event in the history of Westeros - the end of the game of thrones.

&#x200B;

And in order to ""break the wheel"" (ironic, ik) Daenerys had to prove herself not any better than those who ruled before her, and the show portrayed it beautifully. 

&#x200B;

The beginning of her end was when she begged John Snow not to reveal his true identity. Up until that point you would never think that Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, the Breaker of Chains, the badass girl that led thousands of followers after her across the sea was one to beg. But she understands full well what would the consequences be, and after getting so close to winning her throne, the thought of suddenly losing it stresses her out so much that she can't think straight. Why not marry John instead?

&#x200B;

Then there's the feast after the living won the dead. Daenerys watches as Tormund hails for John and says something like, ""What kind of a man rides a dragon? A mad man, or a King!"". At some point Daenerys walks up and leaves and later that day she tells John that she recognizes the way people look at him, that it's the same way people used to look at her back in Essos, but never here in Westeros. Why not rule Essos then? But she is infatuated with this idea that she belongs with the Iron Throne.

&#x200B;

And then there's probably the most impactful scene in the entire show, when John Snow comes to visit Tyrion in his cell right before killing Daenerys. Tyrion tells him that Daenerys' infatuation with the throne blinds her to reality, and that she is going to keep ""liberating"" city after city until she rules them all.

&#x200B;

And the lesson I found in all that, after watching everything again with neutral eyes, is that you can't take what isn't yours. Every single character who had this vision that they are something grand and miraculous  - found themselves in over the head and eventually lost.

&#x200B;

Probably the most important characters are Tyrion and Varis. Both are humble and realistic, never blinded to the truth because of some vision or prophecy. Both are servants to what they believe in, and yet both rose to power and helped shape the history from behind the scenes.

&#x200B;

Varis dying was, heartbreaking as it was, inevitable. He tried his best to serve the realm, humbly, never once thinking that he deserves more, and remaining true to himself despite the consequences. 

Daenerys asked him that if ever comes a time when he thinks she is failing her people as a queen, he would tell her about it instead of betraying her. But Varys knew full well that she is beyond all reason - her vision of sitting on the throne is so strong in her mind that nothing will stop her from achieving it. Upon dying, his last words are that he hopes he is wrong, meaning he is still true to his cause, even on the verge of death.

"[D] Help Understanding the Following Formula I am trying to understand the following formula used for Louvain Clustering: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain\_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method)

&amp;#x200B;

1) It seems that the goal of the Louvain Clustering algorithm is to arrange the data into different clusters (i.e. communities) with the goal to maximize the modularity of the graph.

 Why is maximizing the modularity important? Is this the equivalent of ensuring that the clusters are as different (heterogenous) as possible?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I read a few links on the Louvain Clustering and how it attempts to maximize (optimize) modularity , e.g. [https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/community-detection-with-louvain-and-infomap/](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/community-detection-with-louvain-and-infomap/) 

Yet I was surprised when I found no indication of any derivatives. In Maximum Likelihood Statistics for instance, likelihood can be maximized by using calculus derivatives. But it seems that the Louvain Clustering algorithm optimizes modularity by ""rearranging and shuffling"" observations back-and-forth between neighboring clusters until modularity (denoted by the symbol ""Q"") is maximized. Is there any reason why this is done instead of taking a partial derivative of ""Q""? Is it because this is simply not possible given the architecture of the problem and the equations?

3) I am struggling to understand the overall form of the algorithm. It seems the algorithm begins by placing each observation into its own ""community"" (cluster). 

A) Take the first observation and place it into a cluster with it's neighboring observation.

B) If the modularity (given in the wikipedia page by ""delta Q"") increase, continue.

C) If the modularity does not increase, remove this observation from the cluster you just placed it into. 

Steps A) to C) seems like it would take a really long time to execute for even a medium sized dataset. Are there some additional heuristic rules that are followed by the Louvain Algorithm? For example, when placing an observation into a cluster, are only immediate neighbors considered? Is it really possible for the Louvain Algorithm to cycle through steps A) to C) for all observations in the data, considering all combinations? This seems like an exponential number of calculations are required: calculating and recording each slight increase in modularity for every given step. 

Have I understood this correctly?

Thanks",data science

"Why I believe Bitcoin is the biggest achievement for Artificial Intelligence Bitcoin is the next biggest thing after Internet. I support this analogy, because computers &amp; the Internet made possible these digitizing different types of content:

* MP3 instead of audiocassettes

* MP4 instead of analog signal for TV &amp; VHS

* Email, JPG instead of paper mail &amp; fax

* Skype instead of analog phone lines

* Photographic plates to digital photography

* Typewriters to digital typing



World experienced changes in these groundbreaking digitization which happened very fast thanks to the Internet. But it took some time for Internet infrastructure to come.

I find it weird that in 2015 current financial infrastructure in all countries of the world still remains almost unaffected by digital revolution:

* Most people still think that the best way to send money abroad is Western Union (with 10%+ fee). And there's a good reason why people choose WU to handle international transactions, because try to offer any better user-friendly and fastest way to send money from U.S. to any other country in the world, and you'll find its almost impossible task using traditional services.

* There are still antique paper systems, checks, contracts required in to accomplish most of routine payments. All these things aren't done over the Internet

* In many places except U.S. there are still too much ridiculous restrictions exist for opening banking accounts. These restrictions often imply banking days and banking hours, because banks have such banking hours when you're the most free (usually they're closed at evening). And almost every bank have almost complete control over your funds (not you), and if they think so, they can freeze your funds, or they can confiscate it. E.g. in Australia if you don't touch your funds in your banking account for more than 3 years, they have rights to take them away from you.

* Writing financial apps for past-century paper financial infrastructure is a very boring non-innovative process which meets a lots of obstacles because of necessity for having right permissions, licenses, complying with regulations. In most cases it is a very bureaucratic process.


That's why I believe the Bitcoin is the brightest solution &amp; best legitimate replacement for traditional banking for any kinds of programmers and for any kinds of apps.

Right now Bitcoin network is completely autonomous. The whole structure of the network is built the way, there's no need to trust anyone. Also it is absolutely impossible to change the architecture of Bitcoin network, because every client in Bitcoin network follow very strict protocol backed by high-level cryptography.

By simple words - and all monetary policy is completely controlled by machines, **no human can intervene into this process**! And this way Bitcoin is very similar to the concept of artificial intelligence itself, because the most powerful thing about artificial intelligence is the fact that AI is independent, self-sustainable, self-sufficient and self-governing mechanism.

Mechanisms behind Bitcoin is independent, self-sustainable, self-sufficient and self-governing, and this way Bitcoin is very similar to the concept of Aritficial Intelligence. The only difference is that Bitcoin is already working mechanism, while mechanisms Strong AI are will be in a progress of development for many decades or even milleniums.",data science

I'm not sure how you decide whether at that point Viserys or Robert was the ""true"" king or heir other than just military strength or personal opinion. 

From a purely practical standpoint, all the lords who supported Renly rather than Stannis before his death are unlikely to support Stannis afterwards, not least because his inflexible views on treason and justice would end up with him executing a lot of them.",game of thrones

"Combining Synthetic Data with Real Data to Improve Detection Results in Satellite Imagery: Case Study - Oneview  

There’s a lot to unpack in the title above, so let’s first do that quickly to make sure we’re all on the same page.

Synthetic data is data created, real data is data collected. To dive deeper into the what and why of synthetic data, check our blog post explaining the [**merits and benefits of synthetic data.**](https://one-view.ai/how-synthetic-data-generation-accelerates-machine-learning/)

When we say “detection” we refer to Object Detection – the act of identifying different objects in satellite images for intelligence gathering. When object detection is needed in scale, like going over thousands to millions of images, ML algorithms are called in.

Data-driven algorithms need training. Their training consists of ‘going over’ massive amounts of annotated data, meaning, data that was prepared for training, in our case, that the object needed detection was marked in the images. This is how machines learn to generalize – this is a car, this is a car, this is a car from a different angle, this is a car at night, when it rains, in blue, green, yellow… eventually, ‘they’ get it",data science

"[SPOILERS] After years of resisting I finally watched all seasons past the books, and just finished the TV series Warning, text wall coming:

I spent the past 5 years holding on the seasons that were made past the books published. With the 10th anniversary of the publishing of A Dance with Dragons I finally gave in, convinced that either George R.R. will never finish them, or that he has them ready to be out once he's dead.

Now that I know how this ends, I understand why people were so mad -although I don't share the sentiment... completely- and now truly believe the author will never publish while alive, if at all.

But I wanted to come here to know how you all feel. 

IMO the TV series follows very close what the remaining two books may have -minus half a dozen characters and side plots, albeit- and the spirit of SOIAF is well kept. 

Any character may fall or rise at any given time, regardless of what they have suffered or achieved; the grab of power may give some moments of glory but it always fades; what the reader considers fair is irrelevant; all may be for nothing at all.

And it's because of this that I truly feel appalled by Brandon becoming king. I don't mind Dany dying such a simple dead, neither that Jon never got to be/enjoy his true self. I believe those fates were in line with SOIAF.

However, the manner in which Brandon gets the crown, and the just and basic sense of goodness and fairness that comes with (he doesn't want power, and he's the memory of men) is just unbearable after being hit by the full force of irrelevance, blunt insignificance assigned to Dany's journey. The mix of ""nothing means anything"" but ""the good boy who was always good deserves it""

That, I truly hated.

But what do you all think about it? Why did you love or hate the ending of the TV series? And do you also think the reaction to it is why George may never publish, or is waiting till he's gone to avoid the hate?",game of thrones
"Annotate phylogenetic tree with external data? Hey. Not sure if this is the right sub for this.

I'm using the `ggtree` package from Bioconductor to plot two phylogenetic trees.  It works essentially like ggplot2, and I want to modify the aesthetics of the tip labels to match classes set by an external CSV file.

I have a multiPhylo object that contains two different clusterings of the same 50 genes. When I evaluate `multitree[[1]]$tip.label` and `multitree[[2]]$tip.label` they both give me the same list in the same order, so I know that while the plots are displayed differently, the genes are still stored in the same order.

    mat &lt;- as.dist(matrix(data = rexp(200, rate = 10), nrow = 50, ncol = 50))
    nj.tree &lt;- nj(mat)  ###Package APE
    hclust.tree &lt;- as.phylo(hclust(mat))
    multitree &lt;- c(nj.tree, hclust.tree)

I want to plot these trees and then annotate them with external data based on which of 5 classes (A, B, C, D, and E) they are according to existing literature. 

    write.csv(multitree[[1]]$tip.label, ""Genes.csv"")

I used this command to create a CSV file of each of the genes in the right order (not sure if that's relevant). I then manually entered the corresponding class letter in the column adjascent to each gene. It looks something like this:

    Gene    Class
    1       A
    2       A
    3       D
    4       C
    5       B
    6       E

And so on. 

I want to annotate the tip labels colors on my tree to correspond to the colors defined in my external CSV table. I know it would look something like `geom_tiplab(aes(color=something something something))`, but I don't know how to make it so that it reads the data inside my CSV and not the data within the `multitree`. Here's what my ggtree command looks like

    myTree &lt;- ggtree(multitree[[i]], aes(x, y)) + 
        ggtitle(names(multitree)[i]) + 
        geom_tiplab() +   ### What I want to annotate with color
        theme_tree2() + 
        coord_fixed(ratio = 0.5) 
    print(myTree)         ###Occurs within a for loop, forces ggplot output to display

## [What is Car Insurance Quote](https://fukatsoft.com/b/progressive-car-insurance-quote/)?

A progressive Car insurance quote is an idea or an estimation about how much you will pay to insure your vehicle through any given company. Basically, a car insurance quote is an idea or an estimation of an amount you will pay for a policy. An insurance quote is calculated based on the data or information you provide including your age, the car you drive, where you live, your driving history, and some other information. The more approaching you are with your data, the more accurate your insurance quote.

Progressive car insurance Quote are an essential part of the shopping-around procedure because they show you which insurer can give you or offer you the best price before you buy a car. The specialist suggests that comparing quotes from any three different car insurance companies will ensure that you are paying the right price for the coverage you need.

"[D] Highlights of PyTorch ecosystem days # What is all about

Recently Pytorch held an ecosystem day - event, that brings developers and practitioners together to share how they integrate their recent software/packages with Pytorch. Original post is [here](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/highlights-of-pytorch-ecosystem-days).

[How one of the most popular DL frameworks builds the whole ecosystem of software and packages around itself.](https://preview.redd.it/7407gil77az61.png?width=1571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe591337b0ff229cf8d5eb8c56a231cfdcb736ab)

When I first saw it, I registered straight away. But boy, I must say, the schedule and organizational part disappointed me. The info and schedule were in Google docs (and yes, Google develops a direct competitor framework), it was big, overloaded, and hard to understand. In comparison, Google created a simple, easy to use and fancy [webpage](https://events.google.com/io/program/schedule?lng=en-US) with the schedule of their similar Google I/O event. As a Pytorch fan, I feel a bit ashamed.

Still, the event is full of content! It’s great that Pytorch and the Community support each other in better tools development.

To the content!

# Summary:

First of all, I see that products based on Pytorch are growing rapidly, and packages are becoming more and more domain-specific.

There are wrappers over PyTorch like Pytorch-lightning, Ignite, fastai, Catalyst - they meant to make high-level API with lots of SOTA features implemented.

The level of specification of pytorch ecosystem goes deeper each year - we now can find not only CV/NLP packages but also biomedical imaging, audio, time-series, reinforcement learning. 2D/3D Augmentation libraries, MLOps solutions. Some packages help to diagnose your models, like finding model drift, mitigate unfairness, compress them. I even saw a separate MLOps package for automated driving**.**

The whole ecosystem is [here](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/), and it quite interesting to dive into it. There are in total 60 (!) tools, libraries, and packages there. Soon, they will need an advanced filtering/categorization system. 

It is amazing, how fast this ecosystem grows, curious to see the next step of this evolution.

# Posters:

They are here - [https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/pted/2021](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/pted/2021)

I decided to start from the posters. and not from the videos, since imo posters are more interesting.

There are posters for such wide-known products like huggingface, pytorch lightning, etc. - I won’t mention them. Below is the list of something new/interesting that I personally want to mention.

* [**PyTorch development in VS Code**](https://assets.pytorch.org/pted2021/posters/A4.png) **-** they have profiler and tensorboard integration. I am using PyChram right now, but thinking more and more about switching to VS code.

# Videos:

There are opening talk videos for EMEA and APAC.

* [Morning/EMEA Opening Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYE01-XaSZA)
* [Evening/APAC Opening Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjU_6OaYKpw)

They are more or less the same. To be honest, I would recommend skipping those and watch cuts from them instead.

[**My Journey to PyTorch by Piotr Bialecki @Nvidia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZcWPG-7zA0)  
You probably know Piotr Bialecki if you are using pytorch - he is the guy who answers most of the questions in pytorch forum. Piotr is the Technical Lead of The PyTorch Team @ NVIDIA.  
He speaks about his path in ML/DL, how he started to use pytorch, he reflects on the past and looks forward.  
You should watch that, if you need a little inspiration.

"Minitab GLM and R GAD giving different expected mean squares tables for mixed fx nested ANOVAs. Anyone have a clue how to reconcile them? Hi - I've [posted this on stackexchange several days ago](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/481861/mixed-effects-nested-model-giving-different-ems-tables-in-r-and-minitab-and-i-b?noredirect=1#comment889250_481861) with less than helpful information, other than the F values in my dataset were the same. 

Please note, I do not actually care about the p-values or whatever in this dataset, I care about being able to move between Minitab and R with multiple datasets and have the same results without having to update my final ANOVA table by hand. 

So, with that, I'll just re-explain it. The EMS table produced by Minitab is certainly using something besides MSE for some values and produces and EMS table, but is not selecting the correct denominator MS values for the F-test. The R library GAD also produces an EMS table (though it calls it the MSE table... which is confusing), and only one of their values does not line up. Is there a way I can make these R/Minitab produce identical results so that when I am teaching DOE I can offer it in both Minitab and R?

I have a dataset at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PB_S7oX2Tqgz_BEUUcHfLOww0cNJ-IgN6B34UTequlw/edit?usp=sharing that shows a mixed model where Machine and Station are fixed effects and Power is a random effect. Power is also nested within Machine.

I have run this in R using gad and it produced some results I expected when I calculated by hand:

    machines$station_f &lt;- as.fixed(machines$Station)

Now, the only differences between these two tables is the factor of Power nested within Machine. This means that Minitab and R are consistently using a different denominator for multiple other effects, but Minitab seems to miscalculate the nested effect. I have done this multiple times in R and Minitab rearranging the factors in both to determine if the EMS was shifting due to that, but that was not the problem.

The EMS table provided by R matches up with the work I did by hand, so I am almost certain Minitab is incorrect here. I am also almost certain there is probably something in Minitab I can do to correct this. Does anyone know how I can work in Minitab to produce the correct EMS table with the correct F test? Or will I have to do this in R because this is a shortcoming for Minitab?",data science

"[SPOILERS] This could have all worked out nicely I don't understand the tention between Jon and Dany on S8 of GoT. By this point, Daenarys has proven herself to be a conqueror and ruler of the people. From the beginning, her aim was to break the wheel. She freed the slaves in the east and left Dario to rule over marine, by the end of season 8, before she gets in knife stuck in her, she has a long way to go to achieve this goal. It seems to me that would make sense for her to continue her pursuit of this goal, leaving a loyal, loved and trusted ruler (Jon snow), as she did in the past, and travel the rest of the world in search of injustice. Perhaps taking a look at the west of Westeros with Arya. Thoughts?",game of thrones

"[SPOILERS] In the end Dany just becomes a bitter woman. I want to preface this with the fact that I share the same criticisms of the last 2 seasons like most people. Terrible writing, rushed writing, characters becoming dumb overnight etc.

However I think the writing involving Dany was decent if not good. A lot of people see burning kings landing as some out of character moment for her but watching her growth it seemed like it's most natural conclusion. While they were slavers and potentially deserved their punishment, crucifying someone is an abhorrent practice. Then she burns the heads of a great house instead of imprisoning them (and then wonders why she sees no love in westero.) Her fall from grace wasn't overnight, it was just handled terribly because of the pacing of the last 2 seasons.

The biggest reason I believe she becomes like this is Jon. She quite clearly loves him. She sacrificed one of her sons for him, loses Jorah because of him, delayed taking the Iron throne because of him. She's sacrificed for him, and is angered when he can't overcome the fact they're related. Cersei definitely played her role killing Missandei and a dragon, but the key scene is when she decides on fear not love when Jon refuses her advances. Jon played more of a role in burning kings landing than Cersei did, simply because he didn't want to bang his aunt.

In the end as sad as it is the parallels between her and Cersei are blatant. Not only the bloodlust, but the incest. Cersei becomes queen so she can finally be with Jamie in peace. I imagine Dany had the same thoughts about being with Jon, forcing him to be with her and eliminating anyone who would be against it.

I'm sad she turns out to be her worst fear, but ultimately her and Cersei become monsters to save the only love they had left in the world, and both kill thousands if not millions in the process.",game of thrones

"[Spoilers] What if Ser Barristan Selmy had backed Ned in the throne room When Ned shows Selmy the order from Robert making Ned the regent, Selmy backs him up.  How does this go down in this scene and how does it affect the series.

I think Selmy could have turned the tide of the battle.  If so, Cersei is arrested and Stannis becomes king.  Stannis rewards Ned and he goes back to Winterfell with both his children.  Stannis may even betroth his daughter Shireen to Rickon Stark.  Stannis keeps Cersei and her children as hostages to keep Tywin in line.  I wonder how Tywin would react.  I suspect he would revolt, but perhaps using subterfuge.

Sansa eventually marries some other lord, one picked by Ned and Cat and thus a good and kind man.  Rob never meets his wife, but will marry someone else, likely also arranged.  Arya continues to train at Winterfell.  She never becomes an assassin, but she does become a good swordsman and likely grows up to become an explorer.  Bran eventually makes it north of the wall, but it does take longer.  When he goes, he goes with a small army to protect him.

Ned tells Jon about his mother.  Jon, having taken the black, cannot take the Iron Throne, but he does not care for such things anyway.  He might even start going by the name given to him by his mother.  Either way, his story changes little.  However, Jon does tell Ned about the White Walkers and Ned would believe him and Lord Commander Mormont.  As a result, Ned organizes the north and tells Stannis.

Stannis believes Ned especially since Melisandre will confirm this.  Stannis organizes the rest of Westeros to fight the biggest war in history.  Since Stannis is proactive, the White Walker may even be defeated before Daenerys arrives in Westeros.  When Daenerys finally does arrive, Stannis kills her with a shadow baby as he has not used one before.  He will have to contend with the dragons, Dothraki, and Unsulled, but perhaps the dragons having lost their mother would obey no one and would just go feral.  Eventually Stannis takes down the dragons with scorpions or soldiers.  Dragons without leaders are still dangerous, but they aren't going to win any wars.

How do you think things would change if Barristan had backed Ned at that crucial moment?",game of thrones
"[Spoilers] visual storytelling in the later seasons I always see people argue that there wasnt enough complex storytelling in the later seasons. While yes there is increasingly less and less dialogue as the show goes on, that is natural for any form of television or movie of this scale as it reaches its climax. However what the show also gets better at, and which is often much harder to do, is visual storytelling. Conveying emotions, themes, and plot points purely through visuals and music. 

The best this is executed is in the spoils of war. Where for 6 seasons all i wanted to see was dany raise hell in westeros. And after about 2 minutes of it I am already unsettled by what I am seeing on screen. That battle sequence is so much deeper than just ""oh cool cgi!"" It makes you question whether or not you even want dany there. If there is too much power in her hands, and of course it drives home the ""war is hell"" theme. 

Another one i noticed on my first viewing was the mad queen arch. Since season 6 there is visual story telling in the way dany acts, and the expressions on her face that convey someone who no longer has an interest in ruling, or even as someone who cares about anyone or anything other than the desire to conquer. Yes she says things that sound great and amazing. But if you look at her face, and the emotions she is expressing visually, you could see what dany is truly feeling and thinking in those moments.",game of thrones

So I'm anaylzing fMRI data which is analyzed using a GLM. My question is how do I describe what I did in the correct way?

The way I have described it currently is:

""I completed a project to determine brain activation in a single subject due to the “2- Back” task. For this project, I took fMRI data, which I had previously processed, and performed a GLM analysis. After defining and running a t-contrast, I found that the right middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and superior parietal lobe were activated due to the task. I continued this project by performing a 2nd level analysis using a two-sample t-test design to compare brain activation due to the 2-Back task between healthy subjects and subjects with brain injury. After defining and running a t-contrast, I found higher activation in the superior parietal region and insula in healthy subjects.""

"How would you build a system for recognizing collectible postage stamps? Postage stamp collecting (/r/philately/) is a very popular hobby.  The hobby depends on several large paper catalogs issued to help collectors identify what they have.  But with over 1/2 million different major stamps issued over the last 170 years, and 1,000's more issued every year, identifying stamps is a time consuming task.

Some of the issues faced are:

1) Similar varieties that vary only by price and color, such as the [Machins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin_series) of the UK or [Washington-Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington-Franklin_Issues) issues of the U.S.

2) Cancellations, usually black, but sometimes other colors, can hide portions of the designs. 

3) Differences in the number of perforations (the holes between stamps used to  separate them) can indicate different issues.

"[D] Explainability of PCA + Random Forest on images Good morning everyone.

I am working on a project where I have a dataset of images regarding an industrial product and I am currently classifying each image into two classes, let's say \[good, bad\].

In order to correctly classify the images, I am currently applying the following techniques in this order: [HOG](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.hog) \+ [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) \+ [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).

My performance are really good, but I have the necessity to know a specific information, which is roughly the following: ""this area of the image weight X% on the final classification"".

First of all, I am executing HOG, so the ""area of the image"" could be the HOG Cell. Then, I need to gather some feature importances. in order to get this information, Random Forest comes in handy because it will let you know the [feature importances](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html) in percentage form, once trained. But here the problem arises: my features comes from a PCA. Now, is possible to execute an inverse transformation on a PCA output array and that will give you back the original features array before the application of PCA (which for me is the output of HOG). 

In my scenario, will it make sense to apply the inverse transformation to the array of feature importances? And if not, which approach should I go for?

Also I find it interesting that she's the one initially pushing Ned to accept King Robert's offer to go to King's Landing and become Hand of the King.

### How can this be the variance? ( and these be equal )

[So I've made a spreadsheet here](https://i.snag.gy/FaiX9B.jpg).

[Here's some R code for this](http://vpaste.net/XGCk3) : 

    # probability of each event
    probability = c( 0.1, 0.01, 0.3,0.17, 0.3,0.12  )
    # number of events
    N = length(probability)
    # the events ( so it's just an unfair die i guess...)
    x = c( 1,2,3,4,5,6 )

    # these are for the variance calculations
    bar_x = mean(x)
    diff = ( x - bar_x)^2

    # calculated using the square of the standard deviation
    variance_a = sum ( diff ) / N
    # calculated using the expression given
    variance_b = sum( diff * probability )

    # these two results aren't equal to each other? 


[And here's an R fiddle so that you can run the above in the browser](http://www.r-fiddle.org/#/fiddle?id=VFIUMiO9&amp;version=1)

"[Spoilers] s8 ***spoilers***
***spoilers***
***spoilers***

Ok. Hi folks! I just finished rewatching the entire series and this weekend, I was randomly venting about my beef with some of the kills and started what I’m calling the “correct” s8 kill list. 😂 Curious if other people have a running list of proposed corrections for s8, too? Anywho, here are mine so far, in random order:

Brienne should have killed Cersei. Why i’m right: she’d become Queen Slayer to Jamie’s King Slayer. Then, he’d probably feel weird about it and they’d fight again, but he either can’t bring himself to actually kill her or she maims him and flees out of guilt, because honor has guided her whole life, but now she’s a “disgraced” knight.

Jamie should live. I’m right because it’s just as shocking as Bran living all this time despite what he did. He gets to live with alllllll his guilt and be haunted the same way Cersei was haunted by the witch who told her the fortune about all her kids dying.

I was, personally, annoyed by how difficult it was to (re)kill the Mountain. So, the “correct” fight should’ve started as either the Hound vs. the Mountain, Ellaria from Dorne realizing his eyes/head could be destroyed, then Grey Worm avenging Missandei *OR* Ellaria getting there first—since she was already being held captive—then Grey Worm, then Clegane *OR* Ellaria, Clegane and then Grey Worm—making Grey Worm the unlikely outsider champion just like Pedro Pascal’s character was the unlikely outsider champion. They probably still all die…

Dany kills Tyrion for freeing Jamie. I hate this. But I think Tyrion and Varys were almost too smart/good/actualized characters to survive in the end. This might somewhat mirror the Lannisters killing Ned — piling on to Jamie’s grief.

Yara should’ve gotten to kill her uncle. It felt like such a cheat that she didn’t.

Melisandre doesn’t die at Winterfell following the fight against the Army of the Dead. Instead, she either kills Dany *or* kills Drogon(!!!)

Dany kills Jon Snow in hand-to-hand combat—or, more accurately—sword-to-back (like Jamie vs the Mad King), requiring Melisandre to revive him again.

"Plot ROC Curves in R  I am working with a computer that does not have internet access or a USB port - I only have R with limited libraries (e.g. I do not have access to the ""pec"" library). I am following a github tutorial where a ""survival analysis"" statistical model is fit on some data, and then a ROC (Receiver Operator Curve) is plotted to measure the performance of the model.

I am following this tutorial over here: [https://gist.github.com/thomasmooon/6eb87964ea663f4a7441cc2b2b730bd4](https://gist.github.com/thomasmooon/6eb87964ea663f4a7441cc2b2b730bd4)

Everything runs perfectly on my personal computer - however, on my work computer I am unable to download the ""pec"" library. This means, I can not plot the ROC. I do however have libraries such as ""caret"", ""dplyr"", ""ggplot2"". I was thinking that it might be possible to plot the ROC using other libraries in R such as base R graphics and ggplot2.

    model &lt;- list(""rsf""=container_pred[[i]]$survival[,times_overlap])    
         pec_ &lt;-  pec(

"[Spoilers] How Game of Thrones should have ended With the death of Jon and Jamie, both the Queens of Westeros were devastated. They had both lost their closest relatives, and also the loves of their life. A hurtful Danaerys went out of her castle, with eyes full of red and black marks under her eyes. Cersei, suffered much worse, for she was planning something that no one could imagine. She had figured that since Jamie died and Dany would obviously win against her, She went out for one last play, an inspired move and the Game would forever be changed.

With words of confidence from Tyrion and as the impending excitement of sitting on the throne came towards her, Danaerys and her army, the greatest army Westeros has ever seen for a house, marched in front of the gates of Westeros, whilst she rode on with Drogon  And like that the war started, All the soldiers fighting each other and chaos all around. Dany and Drogon rode high, destroying every crossbow that they could find. For the throne and for Jon, she thought. And like that, there was complete annihilation. With Cersei sitting patiently and sipping her wine, Maester Qyburn hastily entered the room."" Mam, we have got to go out"". She gave him a look, a look of contempt, sadness but an evil look. ""Do as we planned"" said Cersei to Qyburn.

As the bells rang, there was joy on Danys face. The dreams of becoming the Queen, something that she dreamt of from the youngest of age, to finally be able to break the wheel and take vengeance for her family, and for Jon, she was overwhelmed with happiness. But Cersei, the vilest monarch Westeros had ever seen had other plans. With a look towards the mountain, the mountain gave a look to the men sitting at different parts around Westeros.

BOOM! Most of Westeros was under wildfire. People running for their lives and chaos all around. The soldiers were fleeting and the building collapsed. One by one each and every area had an explosion, all due to the wildfire. Drogon swerved and flew but bricks and debris covered the skis. Dany got hurt and fell from Drogon, Only to be caught by him midair. The Game had ended with how it began after the fall of the Targaryens

With the explosion Cersei fleed, she suddenly found Qyburn and had rushed with him into the river to free far from Westeros, just as they had planned before. Her plan had succeeded. Almost. As she went on to hop on the boat, Qybrun gave a glaring smile at her, took his hand, peeled of his face, only to reveal none other than No one. Arya stark had appeared, ready to take her vengeance. Cersei filled with surprise, and horror understood that it was her end. With a dagger to the heart, The same dagger intended to kill bran, Cersei was no more.

Drogon, like any son, would do for her mother, protected her to the best of his ability, but it was too little, too late. Badly wounded, she finally reached the Throne. Thousands of bodies everyone, buildings in ruins and blood spilled everyone, it was a sight none had ever seen or could have dreamt of seeing. On her last breath, she looked at the throne, seeing her dreams and her life passing through her eyes. With one last look and taking her final breath, she closes her eyes, to which Drogon screams and burns the Iron throne.

Suddenly Danaerys was up again, she looked at herself, wearing her finest clothes, unscathed, and looked in front of her.

From Jon to Khal Drogo to Rhaegar to Aerys everyone stood beside the throne, all with pale white skin, and Bowed down to her. With tears from her eyes, she had finally realized her dream had come true, albeit in a different reality.",game of thrones

"[Spoilers] Just finished there series, here are my thoughts for the final time Thank you all who've read any of my thoughts and left any comments. The more interesting stuff is toward the bottom. 
I wrote these thoughts as I watched, when I had a thought worth writing I would jot it down in my notes and now I'm copying and pasting them here with a bit of tune-up of course. 

Season 8

I wish we'd gotten to see more of Arya using her faces and more of bran doing three eyed raven stuff

Grey worm is going to die. Characters don't have heart felt moments where they make a promise to a loved one and then live to fulfill it. 

I would've loved to see Gren at winterfell fighting the dead
Are the gods real? The Lord of light and many faces seem to be real but what about the rest?

I would've liked to see more of the Dothraki preparing although they didn't change much, just putnoon warmer clothes

The clothing that the unsullied wear would not keep them warm, if GOT winter is anything like ours they'd be freezing

I noticed no one in the north wears anything to keep their ears or nose warm, a simple hood is the most we've gotten

I wonder if being a Targaryen is the reason Jon gets along with the dragon or if tits just because he's a gentle man 

How does the night king have so many men that look the same and how do some of them have hair and why doesn't the night king have hair?

I hope the night king can speak, that'll make things a lot more interesting
Ghost was alive this whole time? I don't think he made more than three appearances since season 5

The dothraki having their weapons lit up like that was awesome, one of my favorite scenes and then seeing their light charge was equally as cool

I hope ghost doesn't die, if he does it should be by Jon's side

How did the red woman survive and is she with the army of the dead? She's very mysterious

Ed just died for Sam. I liked Ed and I had hoped to see him live

They can't win this. The dead gave just gotten over the wall and there are countless more coming

It's a shame Cersi's troops aren't at winterfell, I'd like to see the mountain fighting 

Holy shit episode 3 was crazy, I thought our favorite characters would die, I didn't write too many thoughts during the end of the episode because I completely forgot about it. Arya getting the killing blow was cool but I think it should've been Jon

Cersi can easily win now. There is 1 dragon and over half of the northern army was killed, I hope Arya can take her faces and assassinate her

Grey worm didn't die which is a pleasant surprise

Tyrion trying to reason with Cersi is pointless, she is a monster and she'd kill everyone before she steps down as queen

I have a feeling grey worm will either kill the mountain or be killed by him 

The thing Missandei said before she died, I thought that was the word that made the dragon breath fire and if it is why didn't drogon do it? That or she was telling them to burn the city

Many innocent people are going to die and Cersi sadly won't suffer for it

I've lost more and more faith in Daenerys as the shows progressed and I hope she can make a comeback but I think Jon is being set up to take her down in a heart breaking way

Varys is a smart man so I believe putting his rings in the cup and burning the paper was a message for his little birds. I'm not too sure about the paper being burnt as I think it could've been to throw them off but I definitely believe the rings are significant

Daenerys killing the innocent was the turning point for me, she's killing as many people as she can.

The soldiers are killing everyone, why? Daenerys just turned the people against her and set up Jon to take the throne perfectly

Cersi deserved a much worse death, rarely do I think anyone deserves to suffer but she deserves the torture theon received and Jamie died with her. He didn't need to die but his love for her killed him

2 of my guesses for who will die were right and four of my theories for how people will die were pretty close if not dead on, I guessed that Cersi and oberyns wife would die I just didn't know how or when and the close to dead on guesses were Theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. Jorah will either disappear or die for Daenerys. Little finger will die because Jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. Jamie will die for Cersi or with her.
 
If Jon and grey worm fought who would win? They're both excellent fighters and I'd love to see the fight although I'd probably be upset about how it ends 

Why did Daenerys completely destroyed King's landing? It feels out of character for her, yes she changed but she became a tyrant pretty quick

Tyrion is going to partly blame himself for Jamie's death

Arya and Jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. Arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, Jon's still walking up the steps as I type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

Maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

Jon still supports Daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

Even if Jon kills Dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

I thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about Jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

I wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more I'm irritated. Daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. She's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating Jon or she's gone crazy 

Why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, I don't have names or references to the moments I'm talking about because I didn't jot then down when they happened as I thought they were isolated events but they're not. The only people I can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are Stannis, Cersi, and Dany. Obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

Melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. I do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

What will the unsullied and Dothraki do now that Dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

This small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

Robin had a much smaller role then I expected.

I think I should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what I'm thinking

I wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. I also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of Jon.

The north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. Only making alliances when they need to.

What will happen to the body of Dany?

Jon is really getting a shitty deal. He potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. He deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. He's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

What would have happened to the free folk had Dany not been killed? Would she have killed them to let them be?

Why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord Commander since Ed died

If bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? I can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

Where will bran rule? 

Will kings landing be rebuilt? 

Arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

I think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. Elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. I'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

How long was the time skip? Long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

Tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, Joffery, Daenerys, and now Bran. 

Why/how is Bron still alive? I expected Tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

The bickering between the kings table I guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

All of neds children are in a position of power. Jon looks to be more commander again, Sansa is the Queen of the north, Bran is the king, and Arya has her own ship. I imagine ned would be proud of his children.

It is currently 12:00 am and I've justed finished the show. For me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although I didn't like the out of character actions of Daenerys I think it was a fairly good ending. I loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to Kit Harington and Sophie Turner. (I just found out that Sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career I'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

People still don't know that Tyrion didn't kill Joffery?

Who are the best fighters in GOT skill wise? This is a discussion I'd like to have with you guys. I say the candidates are Arya, Brienne, Jon, Oberyn, Bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. I think Arya is the best (rivaled by Jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series I don't believe she'd win, Brienne would have the best chance although I imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. The most dangerous man in GOT was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was Jon. 

Now to talk about my favorite characters but first the Honorable mentions: Sansa, Missandei, Rob stark, podrick, Brienne, the hound, Grendy, and Shireen.

1. Jon snow, he reminds me of captain America. He's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. He trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord Commander ever 

2. Tyrion Lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. His life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and I sympathize with him. Hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. He's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. Daenerys Targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. Also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. She's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. I wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that I've finished season 8 I see that Dany is a lot worse than I expected. I wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but I can't. She's still a favorite

4. Arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. I expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. She might even be the best fighter in GOT

5. Prince Oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. He lived and died for his sister plus he hates the Lannisters and I love that. Sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. Samwell tarly, he has a good heart and I feel sorry for him. His father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. He also cured jorah of grayscale

7. Tormund, here me out with this one. I know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in GOT are terrible people. I like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for Jon

8. Ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. He was a good man, an honorable man and I'll forever enjoy his character

9. Jamie Lannister, I don't know have much reason here. He's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady Olena from what probably would've been torture. He's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. Gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. He defended Sam, supported Jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",game of thrones

"[D] Defining a loss function for a binary comparison problem I have recently been trying to replicate the results in the paper 

*'HIT SONG PREDICTION FOR POP MUSIC BY SIAMESE CNN WITH RANKING LOSS'* - Yu Lang-Chi-et-al

However I run into problems when defining the loss function for the binary comparison between the 2 scalar outputs f(x_i) &amp; f(x_y), after running 2 excerpts through a Siamese Network written using Keras, defined as seen in the model below (from the paper above).

https://i.imgur.com/Cv46n8B.png

Each excerpt enters a CNN, defined in Keras, according to the model seen below, the model outputs a scalar value, which goes into the shared loss function.

https://i.imgur.com/K6t6f5n.png

We have tried to use the following loss function

https://i.imgur.com/IDnC5PD.png

Defining it in Python using Keras as

&gt;     def rank_loss(y_true,y_pred):
&gt;        m = 1.0
&gt;        return K.mean(K.maximum(m - (y_true*y_pred), 0))

With y_true being the ground truth, between -1 and 1, and y_pred being

&gt;      Lambda(f(x_i) - f(x_j))

However, when training using this, the loss converges towards the margin, m, and the training accuracy converges towards 0.

The margin variable, m, is not defined in the paper, which makes it hard to implement. Is my interpretation of the loss function wrong, I suspect it is y_pred being calculated wrong.

"[R] How can I improve my material segmentations? I am trying to perform material segmentation (essentially semantic segmentation with respect to materials) on street-view imagery. My datasets only has ground truth for select regions, so not all pixels have a label, and I calculate loss and metrics only within these ground truth regions. I use \[Semantic FPN\]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02446.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02446.pdf)) (with the ResNet-50 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet), a learning rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.8, and learning rate is divided by 4 if there is no validations loss improvement after three epochs. My loss function is a per-pixel multiclass cross-entropy loss.  

  

My dataset is extremely limited. Not only are not all pixels classified, I also only have 700 images and a severe class imbalance. I tried tackling this imbalance through loss class weighting (based on the number of ground truth pixels for each respective class, i.e. their area sizes), but it barely helps. I also possess, for every image, a depth map, which I (can) supply as a fourth channel to the input layer.

Performance is pretty crappy. What's more, there is very little difference between results of my four experiments. Why is this? I would expect that the addition of depth information (which encodes surface normals and perhaps texture information; pretty discriminitive information). Besides the overall metrics being rather low, the predictions are very messy, and the networks rarely, if ever, predicts ""small"" classes (in terms of area size), e.g. plastic or gravel. This is to be expected with such a small amount of data, but I was wondering if there are any ""performance hacks"" that can boost my network, or if I am missing any obvious stuff? Or is data likely the only bottleneck here? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

"My plan for transitioning into Data Science within the Marketing Field Hey all, I am considering a career shift into data scientist in respect to digital advertising/marketing. Like many others, I am struggling to map a path forward that will enable me to reach my goal in the most efficient way possible. I also want to know the feasibility of my goals here since I do not have a real math or stats background.

**My background:** 32 years old with ~8 years' experience in the advertising &amp; marketing field. I started as a copywriter and transitioned into digital ad campaign management before becoming a marketing manager for a digital advertising agency. I am intrigued by big data and its impact on market intelligence and targeting. I live in a country in the Persian Gulf with no Data Science scene, but plan on relocating in about a years' time (probably back to the US, but perhaps Dubai) where I can network with people in the field.

I hold a BA in Communication (ie Mass Comm) and an MBA. I was exposed to stats through a masters' level class and while conducting my thesis. I learned how to use SPSS, clean &amp; transform data, run parametric tests on my data and interpret the results, although it took me a while to grasp the concepts. As far as programing is concerned, back in college I created HTML/CSS websites for fun and took a Visual Basic programming class.

At this point I already have some pretty strong domain knowledge but my stats understanding is basic and I have to start learning new programing languages. I always struggled with math, but can get to the required level of understanding if I put in the effort.

Since I would like to remain in the marketing field, I am looking at the following path forward:

1) Master Google Analytics

2) Master Statistics &amp; Probability

3) Learn Python, SQL and R (Should I learn all 3?)

4) Participate in real-life projects to get practical experience, either at my job or on the side 

5) Quit my job to relocate 

5) Join a bootcamp in the US or EU to further strengthen my skills and make contacts

6) Look for a Data Science job 


Does this sound like a realistic plan to you? Am I missing or underestimating anything? Does it matter whether I start learning programing or stats first?

Thanks!",data science

"Reinforcement learning or fully convolutional methods useful for my dataset? Any ideas? My dataset is similar to the idea for grayscale rice or mitosis detection , but I seem to run into issues using non-learning methods, such as adaptive thresholding and/or the OTSU method.  Essentially I need to run an algorithm at a coarse resolution to generate possible detections/boxes.  Each box will be followed up by a multi-class convnet that examines the area at a high resolution.  I currently have the multi-class convnet working, and it works very well!, but a sliding window approach is just too slow.  The events at the coarse
resolution are relatively sparse, so it would be nice to use a smaller convnet or other learning algorithm to search for areas of interest that could be classified with the multi-class convnet using the high resolution data.


I am wondering if there is a good way to do:

binary image segmentation

and/or

bounding box detection / regression


for detection of rice kernels or mitosis cells in a grayscale image with varying backgrounds and interference.


It seems like there might be a way to perform the task with reinforcement learning or by using a method similar to ""Fully Convolutional Semantic Segmentation Models"".

http://cs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf


I have been using caffe for other multi-class convnet classification tasks and it has worked really well for me.  So I was wondering if there were other ideas the community might have for me to try.


Any supervised / semi-supervised ideas floating around out there that you guys think might work well?  Or even tips/tricks/starter ideas for the fully convolutional methods or reinforcement learning methods would be great!

"What models should I look into for Generating DnD monsters given partial stats and CR? It's been a hot minute since I did any ML since my college days, so I'm pretty familiar with the basics. Was thinking about a problem the other day and was curious whether my approach is right, and where to go from here.

The idea is simple. Wizards of the Coast has released a lot of monsters, and each monster is assigned a ""Challenge Rating"" typically from 0-25, with higher challenge rating typically meaning more difficult monster. Monsters typically have ability scores, hp values, resistances, skills, abilities, attacks, and spells. I've seen some [simple prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/mikeyhogarth/exploring-if-cr-can-be-predicted-from-stats) being done on predicting CR from stats and abilities.

One difficulty here that I'm seeing is that it would be difficult to evaluate the amount of power certain abilities give if they are text. While prediction using linear regression on just ability scores already gives you a pretty good CR estimate, the extra mile is really taken in by a model that understands the extra tags. Certain things, such as having a resistance to fire damage, may be easy to identify as a binary feature, but this feels much harder with features, such as Pack tactics, which can often be also present with other features.

What I'm curious about, is say that you want to leverage this information to help you generate new monsters, given a CR and starting information. Suppose you want a CR5 monster with 16 charisma and 8 strength and has the devil tag. How would I make a model that generates believable monsters for a certain stat. 

By believable, I mean things such as ""all demons are immune to poison"", or sort of follow the meta. I also don't want the model to overfit and simply spit out the monster most similar in the database, or just approximate the Knapsack problem based on a table of learned weights.

Any thoughts on what I should be thinking about, and machine learning models to consider?",data science

While I think Ramsay is obviously more evil for what he did to Theon and what he does to girls that “bore” him, I personally think Joffery’s transgressions specifically towards Sansa are worse. He put her fathers head on a spike and made her look at it, beat her at court, humiliated her by wedding her to Tyrion. He even threatened to rape her on her wedding night. While Ramsay actually DID rape her, taunted her by bringing up Theon’s betrayal at dinner, and flays the old woman that wanted to help her escape, I don’t find these to be as egregious as what Joffrey did to her, but I am curious to hear what other people think?",game of thrones

"How do you create a matrix where each column contains the entire data set? Hello,

I first asked this question in the Power BI subreddit, but perhaps this subreddit may be able to help.

Here is an example data set of 5 fruits, with information about whether they are green in color and whether they are apples:

|ID|Green|Apple|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|TRUE|TRUE|
|2|TRUE|FALSE|
|3|FALSE|TRUE|
|4|FALSE|FALSE|
|5|FALSE|TRUE|

I want my matrix (or is another visual more appropriate?) to show:

|Condition|Count of Green|Count of Apple|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TRUE|2|3|
|FALSE|3|2|

Above, each ""count"" column contains the entire data set and is independent of the other column.  I am able to achieve this using 2 matrices (ignore the middle column):

|Condition|Count of Green||Condition|Count of Apple|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TRUE|2||TRUE|3|
|FALSE|3||FALSE|2|

However, when I try to do this with 1 matrix, this happens:

|Condition (Green Apple)|Count|
|:-|:-|
|TRUE TRUE|1|
|TRUE FALSE|1|
|FALSE TRUE|2|
|FALSE FALSE|1|

I am forced to combine the 2 categories such that the total count of the values equals the data set.  How can I make it so that each category acts in isolation, and that each category's count contains the entire data set?",data science

"[No Spoilers} Mediumship and Empathy  

I love to write Ocs, it is my weakness... I wanted to give some kind of magic to an oc and either make them a servant of the Starks or make them an actual Stark... either way they would be able to see the dead and or feel the emotions of others... No one would believe them, so they would mask their power and use it for good as much as they could.

If I go mediumship

1. They would know of the White Walkers early and could prepare as much as they could.
2. They would know of the evils of certain people but not all as not everyone.
3. If they are a Stark, the family is hesitant around them as they know more than they ought to.
4. They could and would be able to know how awful Robert is early on.

If I go Empathy...

1. They would sense Jon Snow's pain early and help him gain some confidence, at the cost of the world being unprepared for the White Walkers.
2. They would manifest their powers as terrible migraines at first and be afraid of the Lannisters and loathe Robert.
3. They would also be able to sense emotions that linger making it hard for them to handle graveyards and Kingslanding...
4. They would be more healer than warrior and more scholar.
5. They would resent Catlyn for the pain she causes Jon Snow.

In either case their gifts would be discovered and they would be forced to work for the Lannisters... they would have an automatic foe in Varys who hates magic...

"[SPOILERS] What happened to Lord Varys after s4? He was one of the most menacing character in earlier seasons. What made him frightening to me was 'what does he know?', 'how much does he know?', 'what will he do with that information?'.

He actively knew about enemies, had a network of birds spreading everywhere seemingly.

After getting out of king's landing he does nothing, nothing of any significance. Now we know what actually drives him, so it would make sense of he used his resources in favor of Dany.

This guy could uncover harpies, maybe not the full organization but at least could easily predict attacks or could have known from his birds when masters were planning attack on Mereen. If he doesn't have a network can he not re-establish it. The only place where his network was gone was the King's Landing.

He could have known about Euron's involvement with the crown and now that crown has a navy. He never even advised Dany on anything. He just watched as everything happened  and usually talked to Tyrion, that's it just talk about exposition.


The only time he actively did anything was when he got Dorne and Highhrdens as allies. That's all he did.

"FAANG interview prep: I need your feedback. Is this way off or spot on? Here's the hypothetical from the interviewer:

FB launched a Zoom-like feature. It was generally well-accepted and its usage is growing.

You work at Instagram. How would you evaluate if IG should add that Zoom-like feature?

(in other words, a synchronous communication app within a heterogeneous network (FB) is being evaluted for launch in an otherwise asynchronous homogenous network (IG).

My response:

Clarifying questions:

\- Can some people use the FB Zoom feature with a higher / different  access level than others?

\- What requirements, minimums, or thresholds must be achieved in order to obtain higher access (such as:

o a Facebook business page,

o a Facebook business page with  &gt;1,000 followers

o a Facebook user with &gt;500 edges (relationships since [Facebook can process one trillion edge graphs)](https://research.fb.com/publications/one-trillion-edges-graph-processing-at-facebook-scale/) which the people (nodes) desiring higher access must have people

\- Higher access might include: the ability to invite more than 20 people (20 being the number the hypothetical provided); the ability to place other companies’ advertisements in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; the ability to place advertisements of the host’s company in the Zoom invitation, the Zoom meeting, and/or the Zoom follow up notification; a longer Zoom meeting time (&gt;60 minutes for example)

(clarifying questions partially answered but  mostly deferred)

I would review the data from the A/B experiment on this feature's usage and adoption at FB. I imagine this A/B test would have a dependent variable / control group / training set in machine learning (ML) (user behavior before Zoom feature) and an independent variable / test group / test set in ML (user behavior after Zoom feature).  user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

I'd also analyze datasets which tracked:

\- how many invitees became hosts and set up their own FB Zoom meeting within 1,2,3,4 and +4 weeks;

\- How many invitees purchased one of the host’s products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

\- How many invitees purchased one of the non-host products that were advertised in the Zoom meeting?

The A/B experiment I'd design at IG:

Dependent variable / control group / training set: IG user behavior before Zoom feature

Independent variable / test group / test set: IG user behavior after Zoom feature

user behavior here would include the following variables which would be available in SQL tables for further analysis: frequency (did it increase or decrease after using this feature; in what ways did it increase or decrease (likes, comments, shares, marketplace (buying or selling), direct chat w/ other nodes (users), creation or removal of certain edges (relationships).

Last, I'd run an SQL inner join of the networks of people who used FB Zoom  and the networks of those same people on IG. I'd use clustering ML (entropy weight k-means) to then look for trends or patterns which might explain why the Zoom feature was used more (or less) on FB than IG; which gender uses the Zoom feature more; which network (IG or FB) leads to more Zoom invites being sent out; do IG or FB Zoom meetings lead to more purchases? What type of purchases (category)? What price range? How does price, category and frequency of purchase vary based on GIS or location data of Zoom host and location of invitees? Do the data suggest this might be growing into something like the Influencers feature?",data science

"Boxplot or CI? Hello!     
I have a question for you. I would like to calculate the gross margin for every product sold by company. The selling price of the products is not constant: it depends by many factors (discounts, type of payment, etc...). As a consequence the gross margin of a product is not always the same: different sales generate different gross margins. Let's ignore that for a moment. If I calculate the gross margin for a given year and for each product, I get a table similar to this one:   
Product A: 10%        
Product B: 7%      
Product C: 5%     
The table gives a quick summary but it does not provide any measure of the variability of the data. I would like to add information about the spread of the data. The fact is that I'm not sure if I just need a measure of statistical dispersion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) or if I need to calculate a confidence interval.        
Every sale is recorded in the database of the company, so there is no population from which the sample is taken. The sample is the population (I have a census). According to this line of thought, there is no need to use inferential methods such as CI. All I need is a measure of statical dispersion (standard deviation, IQR, etc...).
However, I can reformulate the problem like this: the data of the current year can be considered a sample of all the future sales. So I do have a sample: the population is given by all future sales. It seems reasonable to say that there is room for statistical inference then: a confidence interval seems to be a good way to give a measure of the variability of the data.
Do you agree?
Are there two different ways to tackle the problem? Or is one more reasonable than the other?

"In a random lottery, to what extent does making additional entries inflate one's chance of winning, and harm others' chance of winning? tl;dr: There is a random lottery for a fixed number of awards. People are assigned to random places in a queue, and obtain an award when they reach the front of the queue, if any awards still exist when they get there. Some people can take an arbitrarily large amount of randomly distributed places in the queue. For any particular individual, to what extent does each additional queue position improve his probability of obtaining an award, and how much does the same reduce others' probability of obtaining an award?

-----

Hello r/AskStatistics! I've reviewed the rules here prior to posting, and I think this ok to ask.

Some of us in the r/PacificCrestTrail community have questions about the lottery system that is used to apply for a permit to hike the trail.

Briefly, here's how it works. I've simplified some complexities of the permitting process that (I think) have no impact on the math.

* Lets say the total number of permits available is **(31 + 30 + 31) * 50 = 4,600**
* Anyone who wants a permit loads the permit website before it opens and is assigned a random place in the queue.
* When the site opens, applicants advance through the queue and apply for their respective permits, if an acceptable spot on the calendar is available when it's their turn.

The issue, and the crux of the question here, is that every device that loads the application site gets its own place in the queue, so people with multiple devices often get multiple spots in the queue, and apply via whichever device reaches the front first. And the amount of devices in the queue is a multiple of the number of available permits, so some people aren't able to apply at all.

*Is there a way to quantify the extent to which each additional device that a person uses increases their chances of being able to make an application? And for each person who uses more than one device, to what extent are they decreasing others' chances of being able to reach the front of the queue before all of the permits are gone?*

If you're interested in the context that prompted this question, the post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificCrestTrail/comments/qryj50/poll_is_the_pcta_november_permit_process_fair/hkmqouy/) and the specific comment thread is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/PacificCrestTrail/comments/qryj50/poll_is_the_pcta_november_permit_process_fair/hkavznj/).

"[D] Is it right to use your PhD student as an expert annotator on a dataset creation paper and not give them authorship? Hi guys, I'm sure you've seen the recent discussions about the role of datawork in ML research \[for example, [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07399),  [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010), [or here](https://aclanthology.org/Q18-1041/)\]. Some of that is definitely complicated, and there's lots of room for disagreement. But today, I came across an example of a well known researcher choosing not to give a PhD student authorship and it made me wonder... what do you guys think?

Here's the post in question: [https://twitter.com/sleepinyourhat/status/1471225421794529281](https://twitter.com/sleepinyourhat/status/1471225421794529281)

The names of particular expert annotators (the ones who wrote the dataset) are acknowledged by name. In principle that seems good (I think?). What is surprising though, is that some of these expert annotators seem to actually be PhD students in the last author's department (linguistics)? The data collection itself relied on their domain expertise. Presumably, this is what qualifies them for the task. It strikes me as questionable not to include a student in your department as an author, especially when they contributed meaningfully to the dataset... are we going to have a split system now, where domain expertise \*as an active graduate-level researcher\* isn't sufficient for authorship on the project? Is writing the dataset that much less important than running a model on it?

"What are Some ""Gotcha's"" of Data Science and Machine Learning? Okay, so you've learned to code, you've done your MNIST, ran a few models in scikit or tensorflow, and have a basic grasp of the concepts such as training/testing, tuning parameters, what models are doing...and now you're ready for something ""real""

So in the real world, what are some ""gotcha's"" inherent in the data that will make running any machine learning or models on it invalid or misleading?

For instance, one example I've ran across is a case where there is an inconsistent amount of data for each feature, leading to a result in which more prevalent features inevitably explain more.

What are other such data quirks that any aspiring data ""scientist"" should be cognizant of?",data science

"[Spoilers] Edmund Tully  

Ok, just to rant a bit. But isnt Edmure moment at the series finale kind of idiotic and doesnt make sense? The character isnt really the brightest. or the best strategist, politician, warrior etc. but like why he would want to be king? when the war of the five kings is the reason almost all of his family is dead or fucked up in a way. He probably was going to nominate someone else. Maybe not, my problem is the situation itself and how is written. 

It seems they put it there to cut down the tension and make a few laughs and make Sansa seem more powerful (and the scene really doesnt achieve any of this) Yeah I know season 8 is all over the place and Edmure was kind of a joke since he was introduced, but he spent years on a dungeon, give the guy some slack, and this is just stupid and out of the blue for the character, story etc. They should have cut it out that. It just makes the character worse, and really if it wasnt for this scene almost anyone wouldnt mock him. Also what a waste on Tobias Menzies, they should had give him a villain role or well write Edmund better. I read here that his character is way better in the books.",game of thrones

"Comment This is such a typical argument though, and it really boils down to this: the show answered practically every question you could ask, but some people simply didn't like/understand the answers and decided the questions were never answered. 

The key question to ask anyone who doesn't like the show is what their idea is of what happened in the finale. A lot of people who don't like the show - and I am fully aware of how this sounds - just don't have a full grasp of what happened. Nearly every single question is answered in the show, and there is a vast supply of online locations that are literal heaps of answers.

The show was almost certainly largely written as it went along - but I have never understood why this is such a bad thing. A lot of cultural products were literally created in this very same way - made up on the spot, so to speak - and we don't hold it against any of them. 

A lot of people also don't like the answer, ""it's magic"", either, and that could be a contributing factor. But the island sometimes did island-things. This is like asking, ""but *why* was the Xenomorph blood in Alien acidic?!""

"Historic snowfall data for specific stations Hi all, I don't generally post on reddit, but I've been looking around for a dataset and can't seem to find it. I figured maybe the reddit collective might make this search easier :)

I want to do some data analysis on this last ski/snowboard season. I track my riding data using Trace, and I have my Fitbit HR data as well. I was hoping to find historic snowfall (would be awesome by hour so I can measure ""fresh"" snow, but daily would be great too) &amp; temp data for the resorts I visited. Most of those resorts have weather stations, although I'm not sure if those are tracking snowfall (most resorts seem to use a snow steak for their numbers).

I looked through SNOTEL and GHCN Daily but neither really seem to have what I need. SNOTEL has snow depth and precipitation in water, but no snowfall. GHCN Daily has the right data, but the stations are pretty limited so I can't really find representative data for the resorts I'm interested in.

I also found [https://www.alta.com/conditions/weather-observations/snowfall-history](https://www.alta.com/conditions/weather-observations/snowfall-history) which seems awesome, so I emailed them asking where they get this data from (I imagine they just store it themselves). I also found the OnTheSnow historic snowfall data on their website, which seems perfect, but I didn't find it available on their API. I've e-mailed them asking where this comes from.

"Comment >And then within one episode he just abandoned all that with the stupid fucking comment about not caring about the innocents which completely threw his character out the window. The thing about Jaime from the very beginning of the show was that he cared about the innocents. That's why he killed the mad king.

This is just a theory based on assumptions, because nothing (apart from interpreting the bath scene in a specific way) actually reinforces your head canon.

For 7+ seasons we see that he gives zero fucks about the innocents... he's practically the anti-Dany in that sense, so it is insane that some people place him on some same level as Dany considering how very different they come off within the confines on the show. Jaime, for 7+ seasons, does whatever immoral bidding his father/sister order to help their family gain power to the detriment of the innocent, while very clearly stating multiple times that all he cares about is himself and Cersei, and that the rest of the world can ""burn for all I care.""

Yes, a generation ago he did something that, as an effect, saved people, but that's not the same as claiming ""that's why"" he killed the Mad King... you're taking the effect and claiming it is the cause... that's not a logical argument considering what we know about Jaime.

The reason he states he never cared about the people is because he never cared about the people... that's the character he's been for the entire run of the show. He cares about honor, he cares about Cersei, he cares about being a better person in Brienne's eyes, but he doesn't care about ""the people""... and never has, as clearly shown in the entire run of this show.

I can understand why people dislike him returning to Cersei (that's the idea!) but him stating he never cared about the people is absolutely a part of his character that's been portrayed on-screen for practically the entirety of this show.",game of thrones

"AWS iot data pipeline - general advice on how to enrich and store IoT data I am looking to build an IoT data pipeline. I am looking for a AWS solution that is as hands-off as possible.The main problem is how to store data in a way that:

1) Measurement (raw data from the devices) data is 'linked' with the house metadata.

2) The data should be available for analysis, visualization and be 'fresh' every 5 minutes. Also it should be accessible by other AWS services.

**Background**: 

I am working for a business placing IoT devices in a house. 

Each house can have N devices (so say one device calculating the electricity and heating consumption, one device calculating temperatures around the house, one device calculating gas flow..). 

The devices can stream different payloads based on the house they are installed in (ie if a house has electric heating, that device wont stream gas-powered heating data).

**What I tried**

Getting sensor data through MQTT topic is easy. I also loaded the registry with the  devices names and attributes. The main problem is putting the streaming data and the attributes together.

1) I tried using Timestream. Apparently Timeastream can only save raw data, but I cant really enrich them. Also it supports only 1 timestamp, so either I choose the measurementTime or IngestedTime, but not both. **(Am I missing something here?)**

2) I tried using IoT analytics. This seems promising as I can enrich the measurement with the registry attributes and I can refresh it in arbitrary intervals, but I **am wondering if having all your raw and processed data there is really convenient.**

3) Another route could be to post the raw messages to s3, and then every X time, run a script enriching the data + glue crawler to create an Athena DB. Here my main worry is that the Glue service is quite expensive + this solution does not feel so hands-off. **Any thoughts?**

"[D] Uniting the different perspectives on probability &amp;#x200B;

There are 3 main ways on thinking about probability: as the long-term frequency of repeated random sampling (aka, the expected value), as the proportion of events in a sample space that correspond to whatever we're talking about the probability of, or as a measure of confidence/uncertainty. These are often contrasted as being 3 totally definitions that are in competition (mainly the first and last options), which I don't quite get, because it doesn't seem like it's really that hard to unit them.

Here's how I see it: For example, if there's a 50% probability some event will happen, I interpret that as meaning that, out of all possible “worlds"" (or to be more specific, all permutations of relevant variables), 50% of them (proportion definition) have that event happening and hence, if we could somehow repeatedly randomly sample out of all possible “worlds"", we would expect the event to happen in 50% of these samplings (frequentist/expected value definition), on average. If we had additional information, that would mean we knew the values of more of the variables (Bayesian/uncertainty definition), which would reduce the total number of permutations, and hence change the probability.

Yet, if it were really that simple, surely someone would have thought of this already and how to define probability wouldn't still be an open question in the philosophy of mathematics/statistics. So am I missing something? Is there some flaw in my reasoning above?",data science

"[Spoilers] Best episode to watch to get my Tolkien-loving brother hooked?  Hey all,

I've been trying to get my brother into this series for years. He adores LotR (his favorite books of all time, likely), and fantasy in general, but he's never been much of a TV-lover, and I think the length of the series is really daunting to him (that, and he has heard how poorly the series ended, and doesn't want to sink too much time into it because of it). For some context, I'm also trying to get him to read the books, but I'd prefer to be able to *watch* along with him so we could enjoy it together.

As disappointed as I was with the ending myself, I still love the show, and in particular, think the early seasons are some of the best fantasy television around-- I can't imagine him not enjoying it, if he gave it a fair shot.

**After some teeth-pulling, I have the opportunity to show him a single episode to try to get him hooked.** Which episode do you think best encapsulates the magic of those early seasons, while being accessible to someone coming in cold, and not *too* spoilery?

I'm actually currently doing a rewatch, and after just finishing it, I am heavily considering S4E9 (""The Watchers on the Wall""). You've got a pretty cool fight sequence, some story/character-building before the fight, and I think it would be relatively easy to see what roles the characters fill, even coming in cold. There's the death of Ygritte, which is a spoiler, to be sure, but it's not on par with, say, the Red Wedding, etc. It's potentially flawed in that the entire episode takes place in one setting, which doesn't give you a taste of the huge scope of the world, though (something I can imagine a Tolkien-lover enjoying).

Anyway, I'm interested to hear what anyone who has read the books or seen (and still has some admiration for) the TV show thinks about how I could best get him hooked.

I made my way through the [Moschitti paper](http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/ML2009-10/TK-ECML2006.pdf) on PT kernels and I just got through [the SPTK kernel paper](http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/articles/2011/EMNLP-SPTK2011.pdf).

I get the idea behind the SPTK kernel: it adds a lexical similarity function $\sigma(n_1, n_2)$ that measures the similarity of two nodes' labels, so shared trees with different leaves but similar meanings contribute to the overall kernel between trees. However, I'm confused what $\sigma(n_1, n_2)$ would output when $n_1$ / $n_2$ are non-terminal nodes. In a parse tree just the terminals are labelled with the actual words; the non-terminals have syntactic POS tags like JJ, NP, etc. right? So how would non-terminal nodes be compared?",data science

"Trying to get my life figured out... TL:DR

Having trouble getting my career started, and not sure if I should get my masters or continue applying for jobs.

I am 24 years old, and graduated with my BS in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics back in May 2018. Since graduating, I have tried landing a data analyst position, but have not had any luck. I currently work as a budget/financial analyst for my local healthcare system, but I am not really fond of the job, and only continue to work it becuase I have not been offered anything better thus far.

I have been getting pretty down seeing a lot of people I graduated high school and college with thriving in their career, while I have yet to really even start mine.

I'm stuck between deciding to just hope for the best and continue applying for data analyst positions, or go back to school and get my masters.

The main thing holding me back from getting my masters is having to take more loans out. The thought of putting myself in debt another $40k or so sounds draining.

But let's say I do take the masters route...

I am not 100% sure what I want to get my masters in. I eventually would like to work in data analytics/data science working with enviromental sustainability and conservation data. Are there any good programs that combine the two interests? Or should I focus on data science, and then just apply for jobs that combine the two?

"[Spoilers] First Time Watching Game of Thrones i have just finished watching game of thrones for the first time and i dont really have any friends that have seen the show so i felt i needed somewhere to express my opinions.

i absolutely adored seasons 1-6 with season 5 being my least favorite up until episode 8 of that season where it gets incredible.  i loved daenerys and i loved jon as well as many other characters ofc.  season 7 in my opinion was undoubtedly the best season of the show.  everyone was exactly where they needed to be and all my favorite characters were succeeding.  jon and daenerys seem as though they are meant to be together and their love feels truly natural.  jon befriending the dragons was wonderful.  i do wish that daenerys had a sweet moment with Ghost.  that said, the last 30 minutes of the last episode of season 7 really ruin a lot for me.  i hate the dragon dying and becoming undead and i hate the revelation that jon is not a snow or stark and i hate even more that he is related to daenerys.  i think that the first three episodes of season 8 are great with the exception of any discussions about jons heritage.  after that its a shit show and i cant stand daenerys character arc ending up as a villain.  i do not like jon being sent away having just killed the love of his life and i do not like bran ruling.

in my perfect world this is how the show would have ended:
seasons 1-7 go exactly as they were made except for the final episode of season 7 and also except for the early realization that jon is not neds son.  

while daenerys is saving jon from being trapped by the army of dead, instead of her dragon being killed, it is wounded badly and flys away.  

in season 8, while daenerys is discussing her love for jon with sansa, instead of someone interrupting, daenerys confessed that she intended to rule the seven kingdoms with jon by her side.  hence the song of ice and fire.  ice and fire uniting to bring peace to the world.

instead of jorja mormont saving daenerys when she is trapped in the long night, she finds herself completely alone and surrounded.  there is no hope until her wounded dragon finally returns and saves her.  soon after, jon and daenerys both ride dragons with the armies to kings landing and take the throne without causing needless mass destruction.  i dont have an opinion with what happens to cersei but i would want the show to end with jon marrying daenerys.

daenerys becoming a villain almost negates the whole show for me.  i have no interest in ever rewatching it because her journey in becoming a strong and kind leader is pointless now.

im not sure if anyone will read this whole thing but i felt like sharing my thoughts.  let me know if you would like my opinion on anything lol.",game of thrones

"Improving model fitting based on multiple data sets Hi all - 

Have a project I'm working on and am running into an issue. Essentially I these points scattered across an x / y plot. I have one test point, where I get the target data (y) for the classification (number from 1 - 6). I have lots points where I have depth indexed data, with some features. The issue with these points is that I don't get a lot of data per point (maybe 100 points).

I'm using the point closest to the test point to fit the model, then trying to generalize that to the other points that are farther apart. It's not giving me great results.

I understand there's not a lot of data to fit to so I'm trying to improve the model by adding a set of 'k' points close to the test point.

These points all share the same columns, so I've tried to add vertically, but then my indexes don't match with the predictor variable y.

I've tried to concat them at the end using a suffix denoting the specific point id, but then I get an error about the amount of input features (for one point) when I try predicting again with the model using combined features.

Is there another model or technique I can use for this?",data science

"Help needed regarding weights argument in lmer R Hi!  


I do not have much of a statistical background and I am working on linear mixed effect models, where for my data I have to do additionally use the arguments of weights. I am looking online but I am having trouble implementing it for my data. My dataframe consists of \~4000 values. These values are broadly categorised into four categories (\~500, \~900, \~1500, \~1300) which add up to the total of \~4000. As these four categories have different sample sizes, I intend to remove the confounding due to the varied distribution.

"Unsure of Whether to Take the GRE Math Subject Test I'm currently looking into statistics masters programs. One program that I think looks great is University of Washington's, however there is a problem. Their website claims applicants ""are strongly encouraged but not required to take the GRE Mathematics Subject Test"". From this, it sounds like the subject test is more or less necessary, but I'm having doubts about taking it for a few reasons:

1. I'm a computer science major, with a math minor. It sounds like a lot of the test is calc and linear algebra, which I got A's in, but it's been ~2 years since doing any calc. The test also covers certain topics I have not taken a class on (namely Diff Eq and Analysis).
2. UW seems to be a pretty competitive program, and I feel something short of a pretty good score could actually *hurt* my chances of acceptance.
3. It's practically the only masters program I've seen that *does* recommend the math subject test. It seems like studying for this would be a lot of work for one school, and there's always the possibility of not even getting in.

I feel very confident in getting ~90% percentile on the quant section of the GRE, but the subject test is something else. I'm not looking to dodge hard work, and I'm willing to put in the time for studying for this, but I'm trying to be realistic about some of the problems listed above. Any advice would be appreciated.

"[SPOILERS] What if the show had ended at the events of the season 4 finale ? I think it's interesting to know that ASOIAF was supposed to be a trilogy and if you look at the pacing GRRM was writing, the first three books were 2 years apart each but beginning with AFFC it took him five years to write it and then another six years for ADWD which tells me he might have run out of ideas once he was done with ASOS and it took him a while to come up with something else.

But books aside, let's only talk about the show here and imagine that D&D decided to end it at the events of the S4 finale ?

For reminder at this point in the show this is where the main plots were at:

\-Tyrion killed Tywin and flees King's Landing to join Daenerys

\-Sansa becomes LF's apprentice

\-Arya sails to Bravos to join the faceless men

\-Jon buries Ygritte (well he burnt her corpse but you get what I mean)

\-Stannis arrives at Castle Black

\-Daenerys locks her children away

\-Brann finds the Three-Eyed-Raven

Do you think this kind of ""there-is-still-so-much-to- unpack-with-these-characters-but-it- still-feels-like-a-closure-to-their-stories"" ending would have worked ?

"[spoilers] the acquiring of the unsullied army I have been rewatching the show recently. The whole story of how Dany Targarean was able to acquire the unsullied army feels like a child's story and thought. Even in the books, it was not drastically different. The idea that u can buy a warrior then ask that warrior to kill its own previous owner  easily is very unrealistic and childish and even a bit stupid. 

Especially those are highly trained warriors with very specific rule to follow rules. As the main seller and trainer, the first rule I would instill, never attack me! I am above all, including ur new owner. Dany cannot be the first person to ever think of this stupid plan. 

I know the fact that she bought all of them meant there is no one to defend. But the seller would've known that, he would've had a rule of a max purchase by one person. The trainer didn't have any contingency plan for this very stupid and easily anticipated move by Danny. 

Anyway I look at it, it feels too flimsy of a plot to acquire an army without doing anything smart. I love the smartness of game of thrones plots (especially in the book) but this one is too weak by even normal movie /show standards

"[SPOILERS] Finally finished my 2+ year journey of listening to the audio books after experiencing Game of Thrones first purely through the show. I purposely held off on reading the books or listening to the audio books until the show ran its course so I could enjoy it to its fullest.  I know a lot of book readers didn't like a lot of the stuff with the show and where it diverted.  I had the same issue as a book reader of the Harry Potter books and as a result never really enjoyed the movies nearly as much as the books.  Same thing with liking the book The Martian way more than the movie.  So it was interesting to do the show first and then the books after.  To my surprise I actually preferred the direction that the show went in a lot of areas compared to the books.  I was also surprised at how little Lady Stoneheart was in the books seeing as that was a common complaint of book readers during the show that she was left out entirely.


The one thing from the books though that was far better than the show was the Young Griff storyline in the 5th book.  Really the highlight of that book and how that all ultimately plays out if George ever releases Winds of Winter is what I'm looking forward to most.  Very disappointing for the show to leave all of that out completely.  Seeing how much they rushed trying to warp up the show and storylines I guess it makes sense because that could have really allowed them to extend the show out several more full seasons.  That doesn't make it the right decision at all though.  The show should have kept going instead of the rapid sloppy finish it had.  



What is the consensus among book readers though with Young Griff?  Do people believe he is Aegon Targaryen or are there theories that he is not actually?  The epilogue sure seems to hint at him being legitimate.",game of thrones

"Learning words embedding for both bigrams and unigrams in a corpus I am working on a topic modeling for tweets projects. My Topics are defined with a mixture of both bigrams and unigrams. 

Now I am planning to evaluate the coherence of my generated topics the coherence measure I am trying to use is the sum of pair-wise similarity of terms that define the topics.

To compute that measure as you may see I need embeddings for my terms, and that is where the issue came from.

\`these, these\_are, are,  are\_sentence, sentence,  sentence\_about, about, about\_words, words words\_enmbeddigns\` and learn the embedding from that?

"[Spoilers] Season 2 does not get enough recognition! You only really ever hear people talk about Blackwater, but this season is amazing to me. Tyrion is at his absolute best, he owns everyone and it’s amazing. We get to see just how awful Joffrey is, we saw it in season 1 but this season he’s turned up a notch. 

We see Robb winning his battles, introduced to Brienne,  Melissandre, Stannis, Davos, and many other great characters. The stuff beyond the wall is great. 

We also see Arya and Tywin, the duo we didn’t know we needed. Every one of their scenes together is gold.

"[SPOILERS] debate with my bf about s7e4 Kind of buzzed on wine. This is also my first watchthrough I am very late to this party.

So in this episode as I understand, Meera has just after a very long journey successfully delivered Brann back to safety and is now entering his room to say goodbye as she wants to leave to return to be with her family when / if the white walkers come. 

So Meera says goodbye and brann basically just says like “thank you” or a very simple and monotone response. (He’s clearly a bit different from the version of him she had previously met.)

She takes offense to this and is emotional and says her brother died and she almost died and that’s all he has to say?

He then says something like “I’m not really brann anymore I’m the 3 eyed raven.” 

Then she says you died in that cave!!!! And cries and exits abruptly. 

So I paused here and I said her response was kinda unnecessarily emotional because 

1. From day one the known collective goal was to deliver brann to the other 3 eyed raven guy / it was known that brann was a special character who was to be protected 

2. He said thank you??? Yeah he was monotone but he thanked you. What else are you expecting? Did you and your brother do what you did for praise and thanks and interpersonal relations or was it for reason number 1 that I wrote above?

3. He is clearly becoming less like brann and more the 3 eyed raven (which was always the goal refer to number 1,) and he even admits to this yet she still just walks out emotionally. 

My boyfriend on the other hand thinks she is deserving of more of a response than thank you. He also is of the mindset that she was only along on the initial quest because her brother was and that she was not necessarily aware of the main objective nor was she aware of Brann’s importance as the three eyed raven. 


Now my boyfriend is going to take my phone and write out his argument for himself. 

1. From day one Meera was trying to talk her brother out of helping him
2. During the journey people she loved died
3. When saying goodbye she got a thank you…
I believe she grew emotional attachment to her journey and Brandon stark. So she left feeling hurt that it seemingly meant nothing to him.

OKAY now it’s me again and not my boyfriend. 

I can acknowledge the inevitable humanlike emotions that she felt but my whole point is that the purpose was larger than that and she knew it from day one. 

Okay now my boyfriend wants to get in one last word since I got in one last word… 

She can acknowledge the fact she acted with emotion…. Hmmm that’s what I’m saying

Ok now it’s me again not my boyfriend.

"Need help making sense of averages in a dataset I know the thread title is confusing, but I'm not really sure how else to describe the issue I'm trying to figure out.

So, I have an Excel PivotTable that looks at a number of companies and a timeline divided into months, and at each cell intersection is the number of reports run by that company in that month. When adding conditional formatting, it looks like a basic ""heatmap"". Now, the next step is to figure out the percentage of companies that ran a report in a certain month, and likewise the percentage of months within the designated timeline during which a certain company ran a report. When built out, it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/DSRz4hE.png).

The problem I encounter is when I average the percentage of companies running a report each month and the percentage of months in which a company has run a report: they're exactly the same, and I have no idea why (in the case of the linked dataset, the averages are both 45%). I tested this with different datasets and the results were always the same. From what I understand, these are different questions: One represents ""What percentage of companies have run a report in the average month?"" while the other represents ""What percentage of month periods does the average company run a report in?"" I'm not an incredibly skilled person when it comes to statistics, but am I not understanding this fully? Are these questions functionally the same?

"[P] Machine Learning for Classification (production grade) Hi. I want to share my experience of building an effective automotive classification process (in Dataiku) using machine learning process. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Git:** [https://github.com/elegantwist/catalog\_classifier](https://github.com/elegantwist/catalog_classifier)

&amp;#x200B;

One has to build a classifier of elements of a dictionary (company) based on a text description of the element company scope of interest.

The classification is as follows: based on the description of the element, a set of categories is chosen, to which the record relates: from the preset options, carrier type, category type, and service are selected – and consolidation us performed for these categories.

Thus, in the end, we get a catalog of type: **Description — Carrier — Category — Service**, and it looks like a table:

https://i.redd.it/79qa6xyqj8921.png

where Description is set from the outside, and Carrier, Category, and Service (if not filled) are filled based on the Description

Until now, the layout — stating the categories — has been performed on a regular basis, in manual mode. As a result, the history has accumulated about the sections of the catalogs chosen, based on the given Description.

The goal has been set: automating the job – minimization, or even elimination of human involvement in the process of marking data.

The following describes how this was implemented.

 

**Three approaches were considered for resolving the problem:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using uniform rules specified by a human, when a single fixed Description clearly matches a fixed Carrier-Category-Service set.

2. The use of the statistical approach, when the frequency of occurrence of words combinations in the Description would be transformed into the frequency of categories matches.

3. The use of the machine training approach for training the model of Description transformation to proper categories in the recorded history, with the final task of making the trained model able to choose the desired categories for the specified Description.

&amp;#x200B;

The third variant was chosen, where the model of Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn package is used. The decision was made based on the analysis of the data history, and a conclusion that the logic of converting the Description to categories are best described by a combination of approaches 1 and 2, i.e. the large number of strictly set rules that in a statistically optimal way describe the required conversion — which perfectly fits the logic of the Decision Tree Classifier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Task implementation was divided into four stages:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Loading the data for processing,

2. Preparing the data for classification,

3. Model training and obtaining the classification result, and

4. Validation of the result.

The standard ML-bundle is used in the implementation: pandas + numpy + sklearn.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Loading the data for processing**

&amp;#x200B;

Make the following steps:

– load the data from a CSV to pandas tables,

– select the data to be the basis for training the model (base), and

– select the data to be used for applying the trained model (the target data).

For the purposes of the article, the target data will be collected from the existing base dataset in order to compare the obtained values with the classified ones and to adequately validate the obtained model.

Loading the data is trivial, with the use of the read\_csv. The result is a pandas table to be used for further work

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After downloading, divide the training and the target data. For the purposes of validation, 5% of the total corpora is enough, therefore we only have to mix the source data, and to allocate any 5% and 95% remains for training — this is a typical “target” amount, therefore we are t be oriented to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the code that does it:

    mask_val = np.random.rand(len(catalog_dt)) &lt; 0.95
train_dt = catalog_dt.loc[mask_val].reset_index(drop=True)
validation_dt = catalog_dt.loc[~mask_val].reset_index(drop=True)

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Preparing the data for classification**

&amp;#x200B;

Once the needed data slices are obtained, they are to be prepared for subsequent use.

The problem is that Description columns contain the data with unfixed content in an unfixed location, and the content may be in Russian, the description text can contain “garbage” like extra spaces, comments in brackets, punctuation marks, or various letters, and reference names of websites may be specified both with and without domain (for example, mail and mail.ru are used with the same semantic interpretation).

For a human, these nuances are not a problem. However, in order to correctly build an ML model capable of functioning “in a stream”, a “unified database” data corpora is required. Therefore, before training the model and its use for new data layout, Description should be made uniform.

To do this:

a) Create data purging rules and apply them to the data,

b) Formulate the rules for transformation of the data obtained after purging for training, and use them for the data,

c) Convert the text data to the numeric format to be used in the DTC, and

d) Convert the result of DTC work back to the text description of classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Implementation:**

&amp;#x200B;

a) By the results of data analysis, the following purging rules have been formed for the incoming string of the description that may appear in Description field (translit, obviously, converts Russian letters into Latin letters):

    def clean_rule(str_value=""""):
      vl = str_value
   vl = re.sub('(?&lt;=\().+?(?=\))', '', vl)
   vl = vl.replace(""("", """")
   vl = vl.replace("")"", """")
   vl = vl.strip()
   vl = vl.replace("".COM"", """")
   vl = vl.replace("".RU"", """")
   vl = vl.replace("".INFO"", """")
   vl = vl.replace("".ORG"", """")
   vl = vl.replace("".NET"", """")
   vl = translit.translify(vl)
   vl = vl.upper()
   return vl

now we can use this rule everywhere you need to bring the raw data to the “unified” form.

 

b) After that, prepare the processed table for training using the DTC

The fact that the Description fields contain the quanta of information separated by”;” and it is not known beforehand whether they are set in a single sequence, and whether the quanta contain errors and “garbage”.

Thus, for each row in the table, do the following:

– Split the string into its elements, or quanta,

– For each element, use the cleanup rule,

– Restrictions do not allow assessing the meaning of each quantum. Thus, it is necessary to somehow reduce the problem with unfixed sequence of the quanta. To resolve this problem, it is enough to arrange the quanta in the horizontal length of the element ascending order, and

– Each line in the Description field, take the first 4 elements (both filled or empty) and use them as columns in the table to be used for training (columns Article-N).

All the above steps are implemented in just three lines with iteration through the rows in the source table:

&amp;#x200B;

    a_l_list_raw = article_list_str.split("";"")
a_l_list_cl = [clean_rule(item) for item in a_l_list_raw]
a_l_list = sorted(a_l_list_cl, key=len)

As a result of processing, you get a table like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3albmy45k8921.png

c) after bringing the table to the “common” form, it is necessary to encode possible variants of the values in column Article (an information quantum for the Description field) into an internal digital classifier, which is suitable for training and for use in the tree model. Thus, convert article values to the binary code – the so-called called one-hot encoding.

For doing so, you will need to:

– concatenate the training and test tables. This is necessary, since some values in the article column can only be contained in a single table, and we have to use the entire catalog (all possible article values). And with one-hot encoding, the variants of the value are transformed into columns, and we have to work with a beforehand known number of columns values,

– perform binary encoding of the values in the catalog, using the built-in pandas – get\_dummies function, and

– the result of the transformation is to be re-divided into the training and target data tables.

&amp;#x200B;

Implementation:

&amp;#x200B;

    var_columns = ['Article1', 'Article2', 'Article3', 'Article4']
     
    # we need to append one to another to get the correct dummies
    res_dt = train_dt[var_columns].append(predict_dt[var_columns]).reset_index(drop=True)
    res_dt_d = pd.get_dummies(res_dt)
     
    # and split them again
    len_of_predict_dt = len(predict_dt[var_columns])
    X_train, X_test = res_dt_d[:-len_of_predict_dt], res_dt_d[-len_of_predict_dt:]
     
    X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)
     
    y_train_ts = pd.get_dummies(train_dt['TypeService'])

 

The obtained one-hot encoded table is to be passed for model training, and for target data classification.

At the stage of using the model, a problem arises in the fact that the result of classification will also be obtained in the form of a one-hot encoded binary data set, which cannot be used directly as a final result. It is, therefore, necessary to retranslate the result of the model operation (as a consequence – the result of the get\_dummies function) back to a human-friendly catalog.

&amp;#x200B;

For doing so, use the following function:

&amp;#x200B;

    def retranslate_dummies(pd_dummies_Y, y_pred):
      c_n = {}
      for p_i in range(len(pd_dummies_Y.columns)):
        c_n.update({
          p_i: pd_dummies_Y.columns[p_i],
        })
      d_df = pd.DataFrame(y_pred)
      y_pred_df = d_df.rename(columns=c_n)
    
      res = []
      for i, row in y_pred_df.iterrows():
        n_val = [clmn for clmn in y_pred_df.columns if row[clmn] == 1]
        if n_val == """" or len(n_val) == 0:
          res = res + [np.NaN]
        else:
          res = res + n_val
    
      return res

which inputs a complete coded directory, and the values obtained during work of the classifier model, and outputs re-translation into the specified original human-friendly format, which is the purpose of the system.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Model training and classification**

&amp;#x200B;

For the process of training and categorization, a standard implementation of Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn package is used.

At the input to the classifier for training, the data translated in the previous step and the expected classification result are supplied.

After training, the trained model receives encoded target data and encoded one-hot classification result is received at the output. The result is to be converted back to the human-friendly form.

We use this approach individually for each section: first, for locating the desired Service, then for the Category and finally, for the Carrier.

 

**4. Validation of the result**

&amp;#x200B;

Check that the result meets expectations. Since we use a known result of classification (the 5% from the original dataset), we can just compare the real and “correct” categories selected by the user to those that were automatically chosen as a result of the classification process.

By the conditions of the, if at least one of the categories is filled incorrectly (the automatically filled is different from the existing in the catalog), we believe that filling was “conditionally incorrect”. “Conditionally incorrect” fields may contain the following values:

– definitely incorrectly identified by the classifier,

– chosen values from the catalog with the Description not met before,

– the values of the catalog selected by Description, which have not been met before, but less than the number of times adequate for unambiguous classification,

– if the conversion variant chosen for classification occurs a bit more rarely than ever, but with that, is present in the history of the record about conversion to the desired class, and

– if the version of the classification has been met less than a determined share of similar cases.

The formalized goal of this work consists in reducing the % of such conventionally-incorrectly filled categories.

&amp;#x200B;

**The obtained results**

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of the implementation of the solution, accuracy was achieved in 60 % of definitely correctly filled categories, with definitely incorrect filling in 5 % of cases, and 35 % of “conditionally incorrect” choice.

Further analysis of the results showed that the obtained 35 % “conditionally incorrect” classifications do not affect the overall result of the system operation (these were either new values, the classification of which was successful, but could not be verified due to the lack of history of translation, or rarely mistakenly filled records in the history), and allow to remove human involvement in the classification of the catalog with sufficient degree of confidence, by moving the classification to a fully automated process.

"What to do when my data set just isn't good? I've been stuck on a machine learning project for a while now. And spent over a month trying to tweak and improve my model for quite some time. But now I think that my dataset is just nnot good enough for this type of task.

How did I arrive here?

My validation losses were almost constant while my training set learned over epochs. Even my losses spiked like crazy. For a long time, I thought this was a result of my model training poorly, but I really think its my dataset that isn't suited for the task.

The dataset is a time series of sales where most columns are 0 (each column is a month) and there are some crazy outliers like 2500 too.

But by and large, most values are 0 with a mean around zero and a standard deviation of 5.

Since my last column/target value/training labels are just zeros with outliers, I think my model can safely label most thigs around there and do well.

As a result, my MSEs are very very constant. (Much like a model predicting every image is a dog when 80% of my set is dogs and only 20% are cats). That could also expain 

Those spikes in my dataset would then also my spikes in losses.

"[D] Best Cloud Dev Tool Hi all, 

what is the best cloud development setup you've come across for industry dl research? (python,gcp,pytorch)

I'm talking about using a cloud sever as a work station for both development + training + eval. 

Jupyter is great because connection problems don't stop the run. But it doesn't have modern tools like debugging, auto import ...etc 

pycharm/vscode in remote dev - require connection to sustain through out training / dev session. But they have amazing tools that make jupyter look like childplay.

"Finished Geron's Hands-On Machine Learning, what next? Context : I'm a PhD student in Operations Research. My PhD thesis is an applied PhD \(in the field of energy\) and it has some ML in it, combined with OR.

I feel like the OR job market is pretty tiny and I am hoping to open myself some doors by picking up ML as well. But for this I think I'll need some ML portfolio to back it up for recruiters, in addition to my PhD. 

I previously learned R with the Data Science specialization on Coursera and \(almost\) finished going through Geron's Hands\-on Machine Learning \(I have yet to go through the chapters about autoencoders and reinforcement learning\) \- although I learned halfway through about the existence of Keras and then regretted not going with that instead of plain Tensorflow since it's apparently easier, but it's done.

"What is your thought on SAS as a tool for data science  Cheer everyone,

I just moved from Python to SAS for 4 months due to new job requirements. I wonder how you think SAS compared with other languages, any future.

Mine:

\- SAS is not so complex. The only problem is we have to memorize weird syntax

\- Lots of problem can be solved with proc sql. Unfortunately, proc sql has some different characteristics compared with standard SQL (e.g. why row\_number is missing in proc sql????). I likely use SAS mainly for practicing SQL.

\- The syntax is unique and not transferrable. If you're in SAS industry for too long, then it's likely hard to move to other jobs with different tool. Unlike if you know MATLAB or Python, you can easily move to R, or even C/C++ (They're interconnected with each other very well, SAS is a standalone hero)

\- Company uses SAS likely for security purposes (need an organization who is responsible for the tool if anything bad happened)

\- Then SAS Visual Analytics is another story and if you program for Advanced Filter in SAS Viya, then again it's more or less different systax compared with SAS Guide.

"Does this datastructure have a name? Hello people!

I have designed a data structure for a small program of mine (nothing special) and I would like to know if the idea already exists and if yes what it's name is.

The datastructure is two arrays, each element containing a value and a pointer to an element in the other array. The corresponding element in the other array also contains a value and a pointer to the corresponding element in the first array.

Both arrays are sorted.

For example, we have the two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[""foo"", ""quux"", ""zorb""]`, where 1 is linked to ""quux"", 2 is linked to ""zorb"" and 3 may be linked to ""foo"".

This would make it easy to find the key of a value/the value of a key via a binary search, which would
be much more efficient than linear search. On the other hand, insertion would have the complexity of the insertion of the underlying array structure.

For each of them, I have their answer to a question on a certain scale.

What is the best way to analyze the data ? I thought of using a Wilcoxon test (or a simple sign test) but I am not sure it is good here, because the order of the procedures might matter and influence the results.

"Comment Sorry to say, but I'm on the complete opposite end, yes it'a rushed but I also hate the choices that the story made to get the characters to be where they were to tie up the story. To me everything had that ""expectation subversion"" cliché that's been so popular in media recently (More on that later).

I'll always hate his decision to just up and return to Cersei, Jaime getting with Brienne was stupid as the show made it seem like that was the only thing he was trying to redeem about himself. The show depicted Jaime trying to regain his own honor that's why he fought so hard to save Myrcella, why he went north to fight with the Starks. And then within one episode he just abandoned all that with the stupid fucking comment about not caring about the innocents which completely threw his character out the window. The thing about Jaime from the very beginning of the show was that he cared about the innocents. That's why he killed the mad king. Most people make a strawmen about his only reason for leaving Cersei was Brienne which is hella stupid as he is a much for developed and complex character. Not some stupid teenager who regret having sex so he went back to his ex as the show depicts.

Bran is the ultimate combination of that YA cliché expectation subversion. It throws away everything about worldbuilding, ""power is where people believe it resides"" and so the peasants are now going to follow a heretical, Northern crippled boy who can't have children? There'd be riots within weeks! Even if he dies of old age there'd be a war of succession and the whole cycle of conquest goes on. Also his ""why else do you think I'm here"" shows how terrible of a person he is, he KNEW the events would unfold out that way (as unrealistic as all the events are) and helped no one just so he could become king, Hodor didn't die for a benevolent cause, he died because the selfish cripple boy who hated life every since being crippled can get revenge to manipulate his way to become king. Also the fact that a Stark ending up as King at all is very much a Young Adult cliché (Oh Look my favorite house now rules all of Westeros!)

Daenerys is very complicated especially in the which of how she did it. Whereas all the terrible things she had done before were to her enemies, those she perceived as such (also Mirri Daz wasn't fully innocent, but she killed Drogo out of Vengeance so it's muddy ground I won't fight on) the fact that she did it all AFTER they all surrendered and there were no more Ballistas is what's stupid where she just stupidly wanted to keep burning innocents, which is such a stupid way to turn her into the full antagonist.

The stupid thing about the Night King is that for some reason the writers didn't incorporate the white walkers into the war for the throne. The north deals with the invasion almost completely on their own with the help from Daenerys. They don't broker any alliances to help, they don't trade for food and resources with any of the other Kingdoms they just fight and win. Which was stupid as hell. They have NO lasting effect in the story after they are gone and the fact that the North lost so many soldiers doesn't change the battle for King's Landing at all. None of the questions about the Others are answered either, they are all just thrown out of the window. Not to mention Azor Ahai got completely trashed. And the fact that the whole war is won because of some slight of hand is the biggest BS in the season.

Rather than tying in all these overlaying plots, the writers made half assed conclusions to each one and smashed them together. Also, wasn't 'revenge has consequences' been a big thing in the show? Why is it okay when Arya does it? Because she's a super assassin? (Also her sex scene with Gendry was mega Young Adult fanservice)

The story had a potential for an excellent ending, even at the end of Season 7 and the ball was dropped hard. There's a reason so many people wrote re-writes and fix its, because there are so many better ways for the story to have gone then it actually did.",game of thrones

"Introducing the ShinyR Knowledge Repo # ShinyR Knowledge Repo
## The **shinyR** curated knowledge sharing platform

I thought I would introduce a new shiny application I have been working on that acts as a knowledge repository, displaying your `Markdown` and `RMarkdown` files listed under the directory. It can even run `python` chunks embedded in `Rmarkdown` files.

##### Links
- Demo: [ShinyR Shinyapps.io](https://jessevent.shinyapps.io/knowledge-repo/)
- GitHub: [ShinyR GitHub](https://github.com/JesseVent/shinyr-knowledge-repo)

Let me know what you think

### Introduction
Built in R with use of the [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) package, this application will list any `RMarkdown.Rmd` or `Markdown.md` that sit under the specified/default directory no matter how many folders there are underneath. By listing all these files you get a true sense of the knowledge collective available to you, and by clicking any of the files listed it will dynamically load the content in a new tab for your viewing pleasure.

Through the reticulate package it can even run embedded python chunks inside `RMarkdown.Rmd` files.

### The Key Principles
-   **Reproducibility** There should be no opportunity for code forks. The entire set of queries, transforms, visualizations, and write-up should be contained in each contribution and be up to date with the results.
-   **Quality** No piece of research should be shared without being reviewed for correctness and precision.
-   **Consumability** The results should be understandable to readers besides the author. Aesthetics should be consistent and on brand across research.
-   **Discoverability** Anyone should be able to find, navigate, and stay up to date on the existing set of work on a topic.
-   **Learning** In line with reproducibility, other researchers should be able to expand their abilities with tools and techniques from others’ work.

### Inspiration
This application is loosely inspired from a mix of the principles of [Airbnb's Knowledge Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo) and the user interface from [GetGrav's Learn2](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-learn2) with my own spin on my thought's about what a knowledge repo should be, combined with some functionality that **Shiny** brings together so well.

&gt; The Knowledge Repo project is focused on facilitating the sharing of knowledge between data scientists and other technical roles using data formats and tools that make sense in these professions. It provides various data stores (and utilities to manage them) for ""knowledge posts"", with a particular focus on notebooks (R Markdown and Jupyter / IPython Notebook) to better promote reproducible research. [Airbnbs Description](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo)

### Next Steps
This application is still in it's infancy, but the next major change I want to make is to allow the application to be given a Gitlab project, and allow you to view all the markdown files that sit in sub-projects beneath it.

Happy for any other feedback or thoughts.",data science
"Where to start Disclaimer up front: I'm not a data scientist, I'm an analyst who has some programming knowledge and knows how to turn data into pretty graphs and metrics in PowerBI, excel, and access.

I've been struggling in two areas in my efforts to move away from manually importing and reducing my data. The first is importing the data, i have a lot of data coming in different formats and table structures, but largely the same information. If I had a UI that could read a file, ask the user to identify specific fields on the first import, and from then on  import with a ""one button press"", that would be super helpful. Currently I use Access saved imports, but those are a pain to set up, break easily, and have to be set up individually for each new data source.

Which brings me to the second area that I've struggled with. I've been using various incarnations of a split access database as both the UI for data entry and data storage. I have no idea what the best database/UI solution is, but I know access isn't it.

I'll take any advice I can get. Thanks",data science

The draw is comprised of all the main characters, as per the wikipedia page, plus some others. Sorry if i've missed out anyone else you'd have liked to have seen but i needed to keep it to 64 entrants in order to avoid byes in the draw. Apart from spacing out some of the obviously best fighters the draw has been randomised.

Some characters fighting abilities change a lot over the course of the show (eg J Lannister or Arya) or were more renowned fighters in the lore of the show but it's not shown on screen (Robert Baratheon), in these cases feel free to choose whichever version of that character you like.

They can use whatever weapon, like how in the Mountain vs the Viper they could turn up with whatever weapon they liked, but...

NO MAGIC! It may be worth doing a tourney in the future that includes magic if this one goes well but for now we wont allow magic because it just confuses things.

"GoT as an allegory for our experience with Covid Our experience with Covid shares common themes with Game of Thrones……

The white walkers are basically a metaphor for Covid-19; in a simple/boiled down sense, they both kill people and multiply/spread (except Covid does it in reverse order and doesn’t kill everyone it touches). In late 2019 the white walkers were hanging out with the wildlings north of the Wall (which hopefully that was not taken as racist b/c I do not intend to imply anything about Chinese people and am simply trying to stay in theme) and in 2020 the white walkers broke through the Wall. They spent the last year pummeling northern Westeros, ravaging towns and villages but didn’t completely decimate the area.

Jon Snow (masks, social distancing, testing, healthcare workers and a tumultuous learning curve in hospital medicine) has been fending off the White Walkers as best as he can but not all of Westeros has been fighting with him. Some Westerosi like Cersei Lannister (Republican politicians/Fox News) have been fighting against Jon Snow, and have even managed to get their enthusiasts to follow suit. After taking severe damage early on, Jon Snow regains some control over Westeros and is able to keep the White Walkers at bay. But after losing a few battles here and there, the White Walkers change the tide and begin to tighten their grip on Westeros again. Luckily for Jon, Danaerys (vaccines) and her dragons (the scientists who created the vaccine) show up just in time to swoop him up and retreat to safety before being overrun, but the damage has already been done as the army of White Walkers is further strengthened by the arrival of Night King (the Delta Variant).

Jon Snow retreats to Winterfell (our immune systems?) and prepares for the upcoming battle with the White Walkers and Night King, hoping that Danaerys and her dragons would soon come back after flying south to convince Cersei and her followers to join forces, which we all knew was a fools errand because Cersei suuuuuuucks so bad and should never have been trusted. Now the Night King is descending on Winterfell and there are people still loyal to Cersei who not only refuse to aid Denaerys, her dragons or Jon Snow, some of them are still actively fighting against the heroes of Westeros. 

It goes further…Cersei loyalists and indigent Westerosi believe that Danaerys can prevent all of the White Walkers from entering Winterfell entirely right this very second. They don’t understand that what Danaerys does is more like reinforcing the inner defense of Winterfell with the help of Jon Snow, while hiring a bunch of Hodors (RIP) to guard the exterior. Eventually, the plan was for Danaerys (the vaccine) and Jon Snow (masks etc) to fortify Winterfell (immune system) so that any White Walkers (Covid original) who made it through would be weak enough and in small enough numbers to not do any noticeable damage, but then the Night King (delta variant) showed up. While Danaerys is not currently able to defeat the Night King, she can prevent him from mortally wounding most of the Northmen and women within Winterfell until Arya and her Valyrian Dagger is able to sneak attack the Night King and shiv him into oblivion.  Arya and her Valyrian are metaphors for a united Westerosi collectively fighting the White Walkers with the strength and wisdom of Jon Snow, Danaerys and her dragons similar to how the first men and children of the forest teamed up to best a previous army of White Walkers (such as small pox or polio).

Winter is here. Don’t listen to or be like Cersei, she’s the worst. Don’t fight against Jon Snow, pre- last two episodes Danaerys or her dragons, that’s just dumb and won’t weaken the White Walkers enough to send them back into their thousand year slumber. Let Arya and her Valyrian Dagger deliver the final blow to the White Walkers and Night King to keep us alive long enough for George RR Martin to finish his last book. The End.",game of thrones

"Probability question: screening mammography Hi all,

So last week I asked a question which, I admit, might have been near impossible to work out mathematically. This time, I'll be ramping down a bit. 

In diagnostic medicine, where individuals are routinely screening for disease, these tests are often imperfect. An example is in cancer mammography where non-invasive tumors or bundles of mammographic tissue can often be confused for invasive tumors, depending on the radiologist's training.

Suppose a woman has a 26/1000 risk of getting a positive cancer screen in 5 years and, of those positive screens, a 10/26 chance that the cancer screen resulted in a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer. What is the cumulative 5 year false positive probability of this screening test? [i.e. what's the probability that, in 5 years, a woman has at least one mammogram turn up as positive when she has no disease]",data science

"Comment i’d do exactly what she did and tell Tyrion. Dany as a ruler sucks and has done nothing but either make thinly veiled threats to the Northerners or show she doesn’t care about their lives or wants as people at all ever since she came. in Sansa’s eyes, Dany is terrible and understandably not someone you’d want on the throne (seriously, who shows up to someone _else’s_ land with a gigantic army, with absolutely no way to feed said army, and then when asked what do their flying explosive bombs of death eat, smirk and not promise they won’t just eat everybody there??? “they eat whatever they want” what the absolute fuck that line is more horrifying than impressive)

like not only does Dany clearly value Northern life as beneath her own goals, but she also wants to bring them _back_ under the iron throne, even after the North has been fighting to gain independence after all these years. 

even just as an audience member i think it was totally understandable for Sansa to give Tyrion that information. even tho i dont like King!Jon either, he at least might be better than Dany.",game of thrones

"[D] Two different methods with the same name: CenterNet Recent development of keypoint based object detectors has brought two somewhat cited (considering that they are both quite recent) methods with the same name: CenterNet.

The title of one paper is [Objects As Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07850) and the other is [CenterNet: Keypoint Triplets for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08189). They share a base concept but are quite different in their approach and the name makes sense for both as both are based on CornerNet.

This can be a bit annoying when mentioning both of them in a paper, but usually this can be resolved well. However, I am currently making a presentation where I would want to list some recent object detectors and this is where it gets a bit more complicated. I do not have to extensively describe either so I guess I will just list CenterNet twice and make a joke about it not being a typo while listing the authors in parentheses.

This is probably not a serious problem, but I guess there could be an interesting discussion on how to resolve any problems related to this and similar situations such as using just the word CenterNet when referring to only one of the approaches.

"ggplot2 geom_jitter() adding ghost points? How to avoid? I'm using ggplot2 to visualize boxplots of the closest approach animals made to a stimulus. I have three phases of each trial that I have closest approach values for (pre-,during-, and post-stimulus, PhNum 1-3). There are 16 animals in the study (IDNum). Finally, I am comparing four trials. So I would expect to see 4 data points for each animal in each phase of the trial. 

When I am using the following code, I get 4 points for each animal in each phase, like I would expect:

ggplot(data = VisDataB, mapping = aes(x = VisDataB$Phase, 

y = VisDataB$ClosestApproach)) + geom\_boxplot() +

geom\_point(color = VisDataB$PhNum) +

facet\_wrap(facets = vars(VisDataB$IDNum))

But when I use geom\_jitter(color = VisDataB$PhNum) instead of geom\_point(color = VisDataB$PhNum), I get additional datapoints on some of the individuals. I'm not sure if the ghost points are hidden under real points when I use geom\_point() or if they are appearing as a result of using geom\_jitter(). 

ggplot(data = VisDataB, mapping = aes(x = VisDataB$PhNum, 

y = VisDataB$ClosestApproach)) + geom\_boxplot() +

geom\_jitter(color = VisDataB$PhNum) +

facet\_wrap(facets = vars(VisDataB$IDNum))

  

I quadruple checked my source .csv, and I am certain I have four datapoints for each individual for each phase. I don't know where these extra datapoints are coming from. Some of the ghost points also don't line up between the x-axis assignment (x = VisDataB$PhNum) and the point color (color = VisDataB$PhNum). For ease of comparing the two figures, the ghost points are in the boxplots for BS10, BS25, CR25, CR43, and CS24. Additionally, it looks like CS21, CR35, and CS10 could be missing points. When I check my source .csv, though, all of these animals have 4 datapoints per phase of the trials.

"[SPOILERS] Ending refurbished. (Last 1) I'll try not to alter too much what happened prior to season 7. Instead of happening in season 8 the battle for winterfell would happen at the very end of season 7. This not a total play by play, I do not go into a whole lot of detail and this is just how I would've taken the story. You'll notice I do not write much on Tyrion, Varys, or Bealish but it's not because they don't do anything but because I'm only focusing on the biggest set pieces. 

#Changes

The NK - I would change the night king entirely. Instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(Bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. This is a major change and makes the NK not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. I would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. He's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. Another change I would make to the NK is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. Necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. Also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#Omission

Mad queen, Dothraki, Golden Company, and Euron - with only 13 episodes left I feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#Season 7

The NK gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the Shadow Tower overlooks (kinda like in Harry Potter with the dementors. This is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) With the assault of the castle Arya, Theon, and Sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are Bran, Jon, Davos, Ed, Sam, Melisandre, Tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

Instead of Arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. Jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. Arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. Also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

Sansa goes to the Eyrie with Brienne and Pod to convince Robin to send the entirety of the Vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

Bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which Jon has commandeered. Upon his return Jon offers up the north to Bran but Bran refuses. Bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. Bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows Jon is the better leader they need. Bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. With the 3ER having died prematurely Bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. I would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

The NK slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. A few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault Jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

Theon gets word of Jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. He attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the Starks. Big difference being Yara supports Theon's request this time. Balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a Civil War against his children. Yara and Theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. Yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. This would fulfill Theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the Starks. Also giving more development to both Yara and Theon. (Similar to Euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. Also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining Theon or Yara like in the show.)

While the Starks have been dealing with the dead, Jaime, Uncle Kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and Dorne. Having slaughtered house Tyrell (I'd keep Olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the Sand Snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. He leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the Tully family. Jaime after hearing of Jon's call for aid would call off his assault of Sunspear and answer it against Cersei's order. He would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

During the siege of winterfell Tormund would sacrifice himself for Jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in Jon's arms(attempting to tell Jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) When Jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(Not going into great detail) Jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time Davos and Ed have already died defending the wall. Jaime and the Lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only Bran, Jon, Melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. Jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. The closest thing I could imagine it to would be the battle for Minas Tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

After Robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom Sansa meets up with Jon and Bran either in Moat Cailin or white harbor. 

In this story Dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. Dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. She puts the citizens needs before her wants. (This would have been a scene with her speaking to Jorah while overlooking the civilians of Mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) Only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the Stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would Dany then begin her sail to westeros. Not to conquer but to save.

#Beginning of Season 8

With the loss of winterfell Jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. With the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

In this scenario Arya hasn't killed Walder. Jon meets up and gathers with Arya, Blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as Walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), Sansa, Bran, Beric, Thoros, Yara, Theon, and the Hound.

Thoros, Beric, and the Hound have been protecting the small folk from Walder's rule. (Instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

The NK continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

The taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting Arya. While Arya will be the 1 to kill Walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving Edmure. It'll be some Assassin's creed shit. Also would have more scenes with Walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

The following episodes will mostly focus on Dany sailing and Arya's infiltration of the twins. Before killing Walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. This will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive Arya. (Little tangent I do think in the books Walder is holding his body I'll bet money on it.) Also Bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

With the fall of Walder Arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. With the surrender of the remaining Freys the Starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. Instead of genociding the remaining Freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

Robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. In this scenario Baelish and Robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall I say manipulation he has over the boy. I would also give scenes to Robin and Royce and show the impact and the positive influence Royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

With the Twins now fortified with Greyjoys, Starks, Tully's, Arryn, and Frey the NK descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

While the battle would start heavily in Jon's favor the Neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. With nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the NK's favor. Yara, Robin, the blackfish, and Sam would die here. Yara fighting by Theon's side, the blackfish Arya's, and Robin protecting Sansa. In his final moments Robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

With The blackfish and Arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. In his final time he would attempt to consulate Arya by telling her ""I never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (Or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

As the dead start coming over the wall Dany's forces would sweep in. While there is joyous, confusion and relief with Dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. Ok now hear me out. It obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(Like that scene from LOTR where Saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) It would be similar to that. The NK is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. He watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with Dany's arrival. (And chucking spears like Tom Brady is just stupid.)

As Dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. She's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (This is 1 time I thing slow motion could work perhaps with Jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

With her untimely death the NK retreats his forces. Again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. The NK is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

With the death of Dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to Kings Landing with Dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

Upon their mother and brother's death both Raegal and Viserys fly away and take residence in Harrenhall. Why Harrenhall? Idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. That shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. And got 1 season left ain't got time to go to Volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. Instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. This would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

Edit  - Having a scene of Kinvara trying to talk Dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#End of Season 8

Having lost the twins our heroes head further south. Towards King's Landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the Vale and holding the NK at the bloody gate. This is however decided against as Jon knows the bloody gate and Vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

Sansa argues taking Casterly Rock and making their final fight there. But as Jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. He knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. Not only that but if Jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

As they make their way to KL it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. Varys mentions they're in Harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. Jon would make his leave at night telling only Arya his mission. To attempt to tame these beasts. In this story nobody knows Jon is a Targareyen. Neither Bran or Sam found out so not even Jon knows. This is a huge risk but Jon sees this as his only hope.

The following episodes would be Jon entering Harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. This wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. This could also be the revelation that Jon is a Targareyen but I think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (Not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

While Jon tames Raegal and Viscerys it mirrors scenes of The NK taming drogon. This is not an easy feat for the NK however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. This would at least be 2 episodes. 

You would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. Cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. War is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. They knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. Only Tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. Cersei already knows he didn't kill Joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. This would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as Jaime is gone. Tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. She's alone and scared of whatever killed Jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. She only agrees to protect Tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

With a distant roar our heroes think it to be Jon but instead it's the NK. In this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) As drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. Drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. Bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. With Bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey Cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. It is too late however. As the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(Not going into great detail.)

Qyburn would take the Mountain and abandon Cersei. This scene would end with Qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing Cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while Cersei cries as she is alone. Tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of Drogon. Tyrion and Cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. After killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. As then they would be truly alone. I would keep Cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. Tyrion. She holds Tyrion the way she does Jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (Not just a few bricks.) Dead Drogon with the NK on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

Sansa with Bran now inside King's Landing finds a safe place to lay him down. Bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

The hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

Greyworm with Jorah, Beric, Thoros, Theon still hold the shield wall. As the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

As just then Jon then comes onto the battle with Raegal and Viscerys. Jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the NK off and falling several hundred feet.

Drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both Dragons. As both Raegal and Viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore Drogon would make his way to Jon. 

Bran having seen Jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. Bran makes the decision to warg into Drogon. (This is not only an animal Bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. The exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) Bran forces drogon onto the NK's own men. As he destroys more and more dead Sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. She begs Bran to come back and to get out of Drogon but Bran knows what he must do and flies towards the NK. His shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. Bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. Bran dies before making it to the NK. In a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) A cat, rat, bird, dog, Nymeria but to no avail. He dies in Sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as Sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and Arya did many years ago.

Jon along with Beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the NK has fallen but Jon takes a spear in the leg and Beric is cut down before him. Theon runs to his side and Jon tells him to retreat into the walls. Theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. He protects Jon but ultimately would die before Jon's eyes.

Greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to Jorah and save him. Having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (Dany and Barristan) he will not fail again. Bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

Drogon would be making his way towards Jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. Rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. Drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. The hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. Both the bolt and the Hound are swallowed up in flames. He dies screaming along with the men around him. While he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

On the field Jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. The NK just out of reach. The NK raises the dead around Jon and he comes face to face with Theon. Unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 Ned did before Ilyn Payne killed him. Before Theon brings the blade down onto Jon, the NK is stabbed in the back by Beric. Beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. A man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. As the NK dies so does all of his followers. 

Jon grabs Theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. Jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

Beric having killed the NK collapses with Thoros running to his side. Beric makes something out only Thoros can hear. Something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" Beric dies in Thoro's arm. Rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's Beric rest in peace. As his watch has ended.

#Fast forward to the end

I would ultimately have Jon rule the north. Even if he does find out he's a Targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" The 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

I would have Sansa and Gendry rule westeros. As a call back to where it all started. Sansa going off to wed Robert's son. She's finally finished what she started.

Arya goes to travel Essos with Thoros. (Not going west of westeros like some Dora explorer bullshit.)

Baelish would rule the Eyrie as Robin left him charge and house Arryn is now extinct.

Oberyn's daughters would rule Dorne, Edmure Riverrun, and Kevan Lannister the westerlands. 

Give Tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

North of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. While the NK died he did save those he loved. Again taking out him being a full blown villain. Being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

Edit - Also Sansa and Gendry would order the death of Lyanna Mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",game of thrones

"Researchers Introduce ‘AugMax’: An Open-Sourced Data Augmentation Framework To Unify The Two Aspects Of Diversity And Hardness **Data augmentation**

Data augmentation in machine learning is a technique that helps reduce overfitting. It increases the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies or synthetic versions from existing ones and acts as an effective regularizer for deep neural networks (DNNs).

**Categories of Data Augmentation**

Category 1:  As standard data augmentation methods are ineffective, more aggressive combinations of multiple augmentations may solve the problem. To diversify the training data, a series of random transformations are composed using this category (Example: AugMix)

Category 2: The category 2 is designed to make the training data harder by sampling from worst-case augmentations that are supposed to fool AI into misclassifying samples. One such example is an adversarial perturbation. Training models with worst-case data allows them to improve generalization and robustness.

The same applies to music notes, they can be connected and form something slightly different through that e.g.

"Pixel mapping/tracking? Or maybe scene mapping or panoramic stitching? I was wondering if anyone was aware of software that can be used to track a stationary cursor (crosshairs in game) within a scene that moves and trace its pattern (the crosshairs movement relative to the scene) in an output?

The idea being to track the cursor movement and look for “inhuman” movements.

I know that certain softwares exist for similar uses, I’m just unsure as to the names of them or the genre of software I need to be looking at.

I have tried a few different approaches that I’m still tinkering with. The first being using a panoramic stitcher program to see if that will help me work put coordinates of movement etc but I run into the issue of the program (Huggins) requires a focal point and FOV from lense, when I’m feeding it still frames captured from a video.

And the other which I’m yet to go down the road of is some software used when people take pictures with their telescope to keep the telescope aligned.

"Why am I Failing Tech Screens? Hello, I think that the same insecurity that some people have around dating is the insecurity I am having around software interviews. I think that I must be doing something wrong, but it's nothing tangible. Once again I had an interview at Google and I was asked to perform a task and I walked through the process, I asked qualifying questions, and completed the question, discussed space and time complexity, and there was time to spare for them to elaborate on it and I was able to even ask the next question they had lined up, and copied the code and verified it worked as intended afterwards.

I believe that I was being polite, articulate, and wore a nice casual button up with a plane background, showered, combed my hair.

Ultimately this has become a repeated pattern, and it is beginning to feel a bit like abuse. I am made to essentially code for free doing one, two, three, four interviews, interview with more people than I can count, learn about them, be polite to them, take hours out of my day for weeks, and then if there is something that isn't absolutely perfect I am going to be left unable to pay my rent.

It feels like abuse because the expectations are never consistent or even expressed, feedback is vague and contradictory, and I am essentially left with the threat of losing my basic needs unless I read the mind of the interviewer and not only do the task at hand, but do it ""not too fast and not too slow"" as the Google interviewer put it to me, act nice and patient, and code with perfect syntax with the right data types and optimal algorithm, never say anything negative, and be constantly criticized and patronized jumping through hoops like a performing monkey

I think that at this point it has reached a level of abuse, because when I interviewed at Microsoft, the interviewer was not aware of .count() in python and I was still able to get to a second round and had solutions to the second round.

I hear people say that they are able to get these positions and they do not even finish the code, and I not only finish the code, but discuss my steps, plan out an approach beforehand, ask the interviewer clarifying questions and if they have any feedback, and try to optimize for space and time complexity, and copy the code to verify it works in an interpreter afterwards

It's really hard to not feel like there is some kind of deliberate conspiracy or something. I don't know what it is, maybe they don't like my voice? Maybe I'm not interesting enough for them? Maybe they think I'm too insecure? Maybe they think I'm too confident in my speech and think it isn't working with them though?

And the problem is that complaining doesn't really help, I just have to passively accept these continual rejections with disorienting and contradictory feedback and I see friends getting these jobs no problem, and I've been a senior devops engineer before, but it seems like I'm always steps behind my peers. I don't know, maybe I don't have a likeable personality? I think I've tried to be articulate and professional, kind and meek, confident and authoritative, agreeable and patient, and I try to cycle through temperaments and communication styles but it doesn't really seem to affect the outcome.

A part of me feels like this is a deliberate way of dissuading people from leaving jobs so that the workers have to accept a degree of suffering to be allowed back into the work force. Like I can't say for certain but it feels kind of spiteful in a way or in purpose. I've had recruiters tell me to send thank you notes groveling to the hiring managers and it just feels really demoralizing, because in essence it is this attitude of me putting in a lot of time investment into these people, my education, my career, and then not only am I supposed to accept being dismissed over anything, but then I have to write them a thank you letter for allowing me the privilege of being rejected by them

It is really dehumanizing and demeaning. For my entire career and in college I've felt somewhat isolated because I have to spend all my time studying, coding, practicing, with the alternative being homeless, it's very much like squid game where you make one mistake and you are left for dead. I do not understand why employers don't look to invest in their employees instead of working with their employees through problems and then immediately disposing of them when they make a small mistake.

After the interview I have been writing thank you emails and even go into a brief description of how the interview went detailing the problem I was tasked with and how I approached it. Both times I interviewed at Google this same thing happened, and even if there was a mistake even though the interviewer was giving me positive feedback (they always say talk through it and work through it with your interviewer but maybe they are lying about that?) wouldn't that mean i would at least qualify for a junior level dev position? They always give the same response when I ask and it's really creepy like they are reading a script

""We are glad that you felt that you did well doing your interview but the team had a different opinion""

Then when you ask what the opinion is they say

"" we do not give information about interviews""

"[P] Fast Face Aging GAN I've been super intrigued by applications like FaceApp, where they age your face. I was wondering how they do it, and on my research, found some topics relevant.

Though it's not near as effective as the app itself, I assume they have access to higher quality data and chaining multiple models/methods together.

The method I used is based on [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/). Though, the best results I got were using a recent method [U-GAT-IT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10830), but it was disproportionately slower. What I noticed was that as long as there is a little bit of background in the face image, the aging filters do not really affect it, so a pipeline with face detection is not needed.

I have done the forecasting bit in python, and now the challenge is how do I integrate the python algorithm with the R-Shiny dashboard? 

One important point of information would be that I have access to Azure and all the services that it offers. This means that I have access to services like databricks, AML etc.

My current plan is to take my Jupyter notebooks and put them onto databricks. Schedule a job on databricks to run every quarter (the forecasts need to be generated every quarter) and then have data bricks write the results to an Azure SQL DB. My Shiny app can then connect to this SQL db and output the results.

"Real-time terrain elevation from video input Hi everyone, my first post here.

I'm during a research phase for a personal project. I want to create a backbone for a system for 3d mapping (elevation) of an unknown, uneven ground when descending (eg. landing with a drone from high altitudes). For the moment I am exploring options of vision approach (ideally, it would incorporate multiple sensors, but I am focusing on a vision now).

The requirements of the system:

* real-time - data will be used in a flight control feedback loop
* resolution of \~20-50cm is needed

So far I've come up with two different approaches:

* classical structure reconstruction based on video frame differences. Probably won't stand on higher altitudes where frame differences are not big. Also, it seems that mainly z-axis movement could be a bit of a problem (until some flight correction is done in xy plane).
* using a neural network for depth/elevation estimation. It works fine for close-range situations, also some work has been done for terrain (recently: [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/12/2002](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/12/2002)). I'm not sure about speed and resolution

Whichever approach is taken, I expect to start with low resolution/precision estimates of terrain and increase the resolution as the drone approaches the ground.

I would love to hear about any other possible approach, any suggestion would be of great input!

I'm doing text analytics with R on the role of interjections in parliamentary speeches. For that purpose, I need a dataframe with 4 columns: The parliamentary session (1-200), the number of words/tokens said in each session, the number of interjections in each session, and finally the ratio (interjections per 100 tokens). Number of tokens is done, what I need next is the number of interjections. Here is where it gets tricky: I have to count them using str_count since they are marked with square brackets in the protocols. The protocols are a dataframe with many other columns that are not important right now, one of them is the pure text of each speech held (~ 100k observations in total). The issue is that I would like to have the string count grouped by session number, so that I don't just end up with the total number of matching strings for the whole dataframe (which is about 50k).

"6D pose estimation of a known 3D CAD object with limited model training for a new object I'm working on a project where I need to estimate the 6DOF pose of a known 3D CAD object in a single RGB image - i.e. this task: [https://paperswithcode.com/task/6d-pose-estimation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/6d-pose-estimation). There are several constraints on the problem:

* Usable commercially (licensed under BSD, MIT, BOOST, etc.), not GPL.
* The CAD object is known and we do NOT aim for generality (i.e.recognize the class of all chairs).
* The CAD object can be uploaded by a user, so it may have symmetries and a range of textures.
* Inference step will be run on a smartphone, and should be able to run at &gt;30fps.
* The inference step can either be a) find the pose of the object once and then I can write code to continue to track it or b) find the pose of the object continuously. I.e. the model doesn't need to have any continuous refinement steps after the initial pose estimate is found.
* Can be anywhere on the scale of single instance of a single object to multiple instances of multiple objects (MiMo). MiMO is preferred, but not required.
* If a deep learning approach is used, the training time required for a new CAD object should be on the order of hours, not days.
* Can either 1) just find the initial pose of an object and not have any refinement steps after or 2) find the initial pose of the object and also have refinement steps after.

I am open to traditional approaches (i.e. 2D-&gt;3D correspondences then solving with PnP), but it seems like deep learning approaches outperform them (classical are too slow - [Real time 6D pose estimation of known 3D CAD objects from a single 2D image or point clouds from RGBD Camera when objects are one on top of the other?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62187435/real-time-6d-pose-estimation-of-known-3d-cad-objects-from-a-single-2d-image-or-p)). Looking at deep learning approaches (poseCNN, HybridPose, Pix2Pose, CosyPose), it seems most of them match these constraints, except that they require model training time. Though perhaps I can use a single pre-trained model and then specialize it for each new CAD object with a shorter training step. But I am not sure of this, and I think success probably relies on the specific model chosen. For example, this project says it requires 3 hours of training time: [https://github.com/DLR-RM/AugmentedAutoencoder](https://github.com/DLR-RM/AugmentedAutoencoder).

Comment My number 1 quote.,game of thrones
Comment How could we pick him? Because he won.,game of thrones
"Comparing incidence rate differences for two different treatment groups? Say you have two drug categories, A and B. Each can be further divided into ""old"" drugs of the category (i.e. A1, B1) or ""new"" drugs of the category (i.e. A2, B2). Say that both A and B can cause diarrhea as a side effect. We know that A2 is much less likely to cause diarrhea than A1, so clinicians will always prescribe A2 drugs over A1 drugs. However, we don't know the difference in diarrhea rates between B1 and B2; we hope that B2 causes less diarrhea, but we don't know. 

So we perform an experiment, and it turns out that B2 causes less diarrhea than B1 (we also repeated the A1 and A2 comparison on the side, and again found that A2 causes less diarrhea). Great. 

But here's where I'm stuck. Say we want to argue, ""Just like with A2 replacing A1, we think that B2 should replace B1; i.e. we should never give B1 when we could instead give B2."" I *think* to do this, we would have to show that the magnitude of the difference between A1 and A2 is similar to the magnitude of the difference between B1 and B2; if A2 has a 50% reduction in diarrhea but B2 has only a 2% reduction (still significant), it's hard to argue. If both A2 and B2 have a 50% reduction, then you can argue you should only use B2, just like we did with A2.

My question: how do I go about comparing the ""50%"" vs the ""2%"" in the above example? My guess is that this comes down to comparing rate differences, but I'm not sure how to do this.

In other words:
If A1 - A2 = A(reduction_of_diarrhea), and B1 - B2 = B(reduction_of_diarrhea), how do I then compare A(reduction_of_diarrhea) with B(reduction_of_diarrhea) to make the argument that we should only give B2, just like we do with A2?

I hope that makes sense.",data science

However, what if I wanted to combine them into a single statistic, such that a higher salary increased the value but a higher age decreased the value?

My initial intuition was to negate the age z-score and average it with the salary z-score.  Is that the best way to approach this problem, or is it just not a valuable metric in the first place?  The metric, at this point, is purely meant to assign a score to each observation.",data science

"MS in Statistics - best electives for a career in data science? (x-post from r/Statistics) Hi guys,

I posted this on the r/statistics forum and I had some great answers, but due to that forum being more statistician based I wanted to see some POV's from data scientists.

I'm currently a graduate student in a MS in Statistics program and I want to eventually work as a data scientist after I graduate (currently fluent in R, Python and SQL.) Looking at my college's course website, I wasn't sure which elective classes to take that would best supplement a data science career. I'm allowed to take 4 electives on top of 6 required courses. The electives are:

* Multivariate Methods
* Categorical Data Analysis
* Design of Experiments
* Operations Research
* Mathematical Modeling
* Statistics Quality Control
* Time Series and Forecasting
* Survival Data Analysis
* Clinical Trials
* Nonparametric Statistics
* Sampling Methods
* Stochastic Processes
* Bayesian Statistics
* Data Mining and Analytics

I'm strongly leaning towards Data Mining and Analytics as well as Bayesian Statistics because I hear that is a fundamental part of machine learning. Any other recommendations?

The thing is, in every Machine Learning project, at the beginning you don't really know how much time you will spend in Exploratory Data Analysis, then in ETL tasks, then in building the model itself, and then in deployment. Maybe I can say everything will take 200 hours, but it will eventually take actually 400 hours, or 100 hours. Also, it can not only take a different amount of time, but also not achieving good results. Maybe I strive for months and finally have a really bad performance (meaning that I would not be able to deliver a good solution to the client).

"Comment I agree. The ending was definitely rushed, they should have taken the extra episodes they were offered to flesh it out better, but I feel that (almost) everything ended as it was always going to. I wasn’t surprised at Dany’s turn, the signs were there from the moment she had her brother get his crown… No one could kill the Night King, so Arya became no one and fulfilled that prophecy. I did hate Jamie’s ending. It fit, but I hated it. Everyone else ended up more or less where they were always headed. 

The biggest problem was that it was rushed. D&D chose to rush it even though they were offered more screen time to properly flesh things out, but also by that point they only had the major plot points GRRM gave them, unlike the fully fleshed out stories they had to draw on in early seasons. Journeys that took whole seasons previously, took a single episode… that’s just lazy writing.

"[SPOILERS] Sick of hearing how ""bad"" the end of the TV show was.  

I  hate how it has become conventional wisdom that the ending of Game of  Thrones was terrible. I saw another article (about Wheel of Time) that  made sure to mention Game of Thrones and it's ""bad ending"".

I  thought it was (other than being rushed and needing about another five  episodes) excellent, with all the plot points tied up in a way that made  narrative sense and didn't feel like some sort of young-adult,  chosen-one cliche.

Jaime's ending  was not stupid and pointless -- it was poignant and spoke of the  complexity of his character. His and Cersei's love was tragic, and  flawed, but it was who they were. I had no interest in seeing Jaime  shack up with Brienne.

Bran was  always going to be the king -- This was always the story of The Starks,  from the moment they were the first characters (and Bran the first  character) we meet after the prologue in book 1. While The Night King,  Cersei, Daenerys, Stannis, Renly, Robert, et al are all just different  flavours of the same cycle of conquest and power and might makes right,  Bran's journey from child, to invalid, to three-eyed-raven, coupled with  Hodor's backstory would have made zero narrative sense otherwise.   ""What's the story about? Loads of people are warring for the throne and  all think they deserve it -- oh, and there's a crippled kid who talks to  birds and trees and wanders around a bit in the tundra"".

I'm  not going to repeat the ""Daenerys wouldn't do that!"" debunking that's  been countered a thousand times. If people haven't accepted that by now  then I don't know what to say. I'll just say that she was an antagonist  for me the second she burned an innocent woman (a lone survivor after  her husband massacred her whole village) alive and then morphed into a  female version of her terrible brother with better PR.

The  Night King died at the right time for me, too. I'm glad that he was  almost a red herring. It reminded me of The Lord of the Rings when life  went on (interesting how that was cut in the films -- probably Peter  Jackson predicted a similar reaction to that we got after The Long  Night) after the fall of Sauron, and thugs and thieves and a greatly  diminished Saruman (who was, by that point, just a bandit) had to be  dealt with. The existential threat is gone, but people still suck. Texts  are, after all, always about HUMANITY first and foremost.

Upon rewatching for the umpteenth time, I had a revelation during S6 EP10 ""The Winds of Winter."" **What if the Lord of Light (LoL) is simply GRRM?**

If this extremely meta guess is true, it makes many lines like *(paraphrased)* ""The Lord of Light brought you back because you still have a purpose to serve,"" make sense. **GRRM is the characters' ""Creator"" or ""God.""** He is writing their plots and thus brings Jon back from the dead to serve his ultimate purpose at the end of S8 (killing Dany). Melisandre says she doesn't have the power to bring men back, it was given to her by the Lord of Light. GRRM as LoL fits since quite literally the Red Woman doesn't have the power until GRRM wills these powers into being via his writing. Their 'roles to play' are plot points later established by GRRM.

All in all, reminds me of the movie ""Stranger than Fiction"" (STF) with Will Ferrel and Emma Thompson. If you've seen STF, the correlation works out to Will = Bran and Emma = GRRM. (Bran being aware of the LoL is not established in the show but I \[hope\] think that maybe the books will shed more light on where Bran is going during S8 visions.)

"[Q] Discussed politics with family and unusual statistics came up - is this equation correct? First of all, I would like to apologize if this question is inappropriate for this sub. It has already been posted in r/AskStatistics if that is preferred. The backstory to my question is as follows:

Ever since George Floyd died at the hands of police officers, my family and I have been exchanging emails about statistics, policing, and race in the US. They have made the claim that “a police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer”. After researching the source of the claim, I found the statistical equation used was: 

\[(# of police killed by black males)/(total police officers)\] / \[(# of unarmed black men killed by police)/(total black male population)\]

Is this equation faulty? When looking at the denominator, it divides # of unarmed black men killed by police by the total black male population. However, shouldn’t it be divided by the total *unarmed* black male population in order to be statistically valid? I have a feeling that the equation and the way which it is worded into a sentence are misleading. I appreciate any feedback.

For **further clarification**, this is the exact wording of the equation by the author of the statistic: ""The 36 unarmed black male victims of police shootings in 2015 measured against the total black male population \[nearly 19 million in mid-2014, per the Census Bureau\] amounts to a per capita rate of 0.0000018 unarmed fatalities by police. By comparison, 52 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in 2015 while engaged in such duties as traffic stops and warrant service, according to the [National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund](http://www.nleomf.org/facts/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.com/?referrer=https://www.google.com/). The FBI counted nearly 628,000 full-time law enforcement officers in the United States in 2014. Assuming that the number of officers did not markedly increase in 2015, the per capita rate of officers being feloniously killed is 0.000082, or 45 times the rate at which unarmed black males are killed by cops. The Memorial Fund does not have data on the race of cop-killers in 2015, but applying the historical average over the last decade in which [40 percent of all cop-killers were black](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_47_leos_fk_race_and_sex_of_known_offender_2005-2014.xls) would yield 21 cops killed by blacks in 2015. An officer’s chance of getting killed by a black person is 0.000033, which is 18.5 times the chance of an unarmed black person getting killed by a cop.""",data science

"Data Analysis Help (SPSS) Hi guys,

So I've designed a study for my dissertation/honours project to investigate how age (18, 40), offence (attempted murder), and diagnosis (schizophrenia, no diagnosis) influence somebodies likelihood to favour rehabilitation/punishment. So this is obviously a 2X2X2, however, I put them into 8 different vignettes and manipulated that between subjects. Each subject saw 3 random vignettes (but was always exposed to both levels of all variables) 

Can I just run it through SPSS as a 3-way within ANOVA, as each participant is exposed to all levels of the IVs? 
Should I collapse all variables into their 8 vignettes, and then run 2 tests the vignettes with only 1 variable difference (I.e. 1a, 2a, 3a with 1a, 2a, 3b) and 'assume' the difference is a result of the different level of the variable and  just run lots of t-tests?

This is ultimately for a dissertation, so the analysis doesn't need to be super complex, it just needs to answer how each level influences the rehabilitation/punishment response.

Thank you guys!!",data science
"How to control for heteroskedasticity in a spatial regression analysis? Hello,

I am running a spatial analysis regarding how the utilisation distribution of my focal animal species are influenced by other variables. 

As the response is a utilisation distribution, the data is not naturally normally distributed. I did run a fourth order transformation though,  and as such, the residuals from the OLS are seemingly normally distributed. 

Here are the residuals for the non-transformed ols
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/luNM2Ny.jpg)


Here are the residuals for 4th order transformation OLS
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MTYZFFR.jpg)

Following, I ran several more complex models (lag error, durbin lag, durbin error) and the error model reigned in terms of AIC, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, and Lagrange.

Anyways, I ran a studentized Breusch-Pagan test with the error model (as it seemed to be the best fit) and I received the following results:

data:  
BP = 25.452, df = 5, p-value = 0.0001139
 
This suggests that heteroskedasticity is present (from what I believe). However, heteroskedasticity is in all (4th order transformation) models (although, Auto-correlation is low in the error)

I am essentially trying to get rid of this heteroskedasticity and
hope to control for it but do not have the statistical knowledge to be able to have an understanding on what to do best. I believe that transforming the response variable would be best, but I am not yet sure. 

Any insight would be incredibly helpful.",data science

On the one hand, you have those that feel it was complete character assassination, that she would never do something like that in a million years, and that the 180 was executed in such a poor manner that it was completely unpredictable and random.

"[D] Question: What are some techniques for detecting manipulation in real-time trading data? Hey ML Reddit,

Consider my hypothetical scenario:

- There exists an online trading hub where people can post the price they paid for items in a video game

- The vast majority of trades posted are legitimate; however there is a financial incentive for people to post fake data for the sake of manipulating the market. Let's assume that this is rare.

- For the sake of simplicity, a trade consists of the following data:


  {
    ""itemId"": number

    ""quantity"": number

    ""price"": number

    // was the trade a market buy or a market sell?

    ""buy"": boolean

  }


- Some items receive a lot of volume (thousands of trades per day) while others don't receive much volume at all (one or two trades per day, if any)

- There are varying degrees of manipulation, and obviously there is some tolerance for minor manipulation slipping through the cracks

What techniques exist for identifying trades as manipulation? Links to articles (especially python examples) would be appreciated. I can draw parallels from related problems.",data science

"Your weekly imposter syndrom post - what do I do? I work for a municipal utility company that serves power and water. I started as a project engineer/project manager, but now doing analytics and my division/group is a blend of ops and finance.

I've been coming here to /r/datascience and after reading a lot of the posts here, I feel like having a major imposter syndrome... I don't work in tech industry, so we don't do the coolest and hip stuff like NLP or computer vision.

I do stuff such as:

- Predictive analytics eg: predicting / classifying pipes with leaks using basic algorithms on sklearn, and time series on supply/demand energy forecast (mostly ARIMA and VAR, not even GARCH since supply/demand for water and power aren't that volatile). I don't use deep learning stuff like tensorflow / keras. Most of our problems aren't that complicated.

- We also do ad hoc requests eg: scraping twitter for certain hashtags and create a map for sentiment analysis for our public relations group.

- Sometimes we develop dashboards using tableau.

- A lot of times I use ArcGIS/QGIS to do spatial analysis.

- Sometimes I do ETL using alteryx.

- My coding skills aren't impressive. I know a little R and I use python more often because it integrates better with GIS stuff. I know a little bit of PostGIS, although I use QGIS/ArcGIS a lot more often. I don't come from CS background. My undergrad was in civil engineering and I have masters in applied econ/econometrics.

- And most importantly, I spend like 80% of my time on data hunting, collection and cleaning. Perhaps only 10% of my time building models, and 10% on communicating the results and documenting them and putting them into our knowledge management system.

I would very much appreciate it if anyone can tell me where or what I should do to get a ""real"" or ""proper"" data science roles...? Or what industry can I leverage my experience/skills to?

1. doing bootcamps, but after looking at a lot of their syllabus/curriculum, I feel like it's a waste of time...

2. I've also considered Georgia Tech OMSA to get more of those analytics courses, and UPenn Online MCIT to get a CS formal background.

"[SPOILERS] I have a question about Stannis... Why did Stannis kill Renly?

I've thought about this a lot recently and Stannis killing Renly was kind of a stupid move, strategically speaking. Sure, when he killed Renly he got rid of his competition and some of Renly's bannermen and swords pledged allegiance to Stannis, so on it's face it seems like a good idea. But when you think about it, Stannis wasn't the only party who benefitted for Renly's death. The Lannisters, who are currently winning, lost one of the major rebels against the crown AND got an alliance with the Tyrells, one of the most rich and powerful families in the seven kingdoms. And now the only person who competes with the Lannister's claim is: Stannis! And as for the North's secession, now that the Lannisters are as powerful as they are the Frey's and the Boltons weak ties are finally broken and the Starks all die, except for the one who the Lannisters control. And the Greyjoy's are basically an irrelevance to the Lannisters. Their only maor adversary is Stannis now. And while he has a big enough army, he is still stupid enough to waste it all on the battle if blackwater and he gets fucked in the ass by the Lannisters. It just doesn't make sense: when you're playing uno on family game night you don't use your plus 4 on the guy with 10 cards, you use it on the guy with 1. Stannis should've tried to make a move that benefits his position and hurts the Lannisters. If your move in any way helps the guy in first place, it's probably a bad move. As far as I can see, the Starks and Baratheons should squad up and gang rape the Lannisters and then figure it out from there. Stannis should've waited until the Lannister's were in a worse position before even thinking about making a move against renly, let alone just straight up murder him and lose half his bannermen to the guys who literally have the crown. If he didn't kill Renly, the Starks would never have been betrayed at the Red Wedding and the Lannisters would likely be overwhelmed and eventually lose the throne. And then, if Stannis killed renly the Bannermen would have nobody to go to except Stannis, he would have the backing of the Tyrells and Renly's army, and from there decide if he wanted to stop the north from seceding if they even still wanted to. Am I missing something or is Stannis just not that good at strategy?",game of thrones

"Democratizing Diffusion Models - LDMs: High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models, a 5-minute paper summary by Casual GAN Papers Diffusion models (DMs) have a more stable training phase than GANs and less parameters than autoregressive models, yet they are just really resource intensive. The most powerful DMs require up to a 1000 V100 days to train (that’s a lot of $$$ for compute) and about a day per 1000 inference samples. The authors of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) pinpoint this problem to the high dimensionality of the pixel space, in which the diffusion process occurs and propose to perform it in a more compact latent space instead. In short, they achieve this feat by pertaining an autoencoder model that learns an efficient compact latent space that is perceptually equivalent to the pixel space. A DM sandwiched between the convolutional encoder-decoder is then trained inside the latent space in a more computationally-efficient way.

In other words, this is a VQGAN with a DM instead of a transformer (and without a discriminator).

As for the details, let’s dive in, shall we?

"[Spoilers] Ned’s honor always protected children to his own detriment, meanwhile a large majority of the other characters were responsible or complicit in the murder or attempted murder of a child... here’s a list of the ones I could think of 4 times Ned makes a major sacrifice to save the life of a child:


He permanently strains his marriage and allows himself to be viewed as an adulterer by concealing Jon’s identity to save him from Robert


He strains his friendship with and risks the wrath of the King by objecting to Dany’s murder


He risks his life and gives up the power of surprise by telling Cersei what he knows to save her children 


He sacrifices the last of his honor and allows his legacy to be that of a traitor by bending the knee to Joffrey and giving a false confession in front of all of KL to protect Sansa. 


Thinking of this got me comparing him to other characters and as I went along I realized that a large majority of them were guilty of killing, ordering to be killed or being complicit in the killing of a child.  Here the list of those I can remember:

Jamie

Cersei

Tywin

Joffrey 

The Mountain

The Hound

Peter

Stannis

Melisandre

Theon

Dagmer 

Robert

Jorah

Varys

Ser Amory

"Will not having a technical degree hurt me in the long run? Hello, 

I was just offered a job in Portland, Oregon for a Senior Data Analyst position. This is quite outside my experience but I am considering taking the job. I do have some limited experience with SQL and Tableau, and quite a bit of experience using python for data analysis but nothing to warrant getting a Senior Data Analyst position. I was actually thinking about pivoting toward analytics but thought I'd likely have to go back to school so I'm surprised to have gotten this job. My question: if I took the job but decided to leave in two years or so, would it hurt me being in this field without a technical degree? I am confident in my ability to be a good analyst, but know how competitive the field is. I'd rather not transition to a field where I'm at a major disadvantage when I could easily stay on my current career path.

"[E] Chances at applied stat programs? Hi everyone,

I know these types of questions are annoying but I'd greatly appreciate any input.

I'm a 4th year psych major feeling quite insecure about applying to applied stats programs. The programs I'm most interested in are: NYU's MS in Applied Statistics for Social Science Research, Boston University's MS in Statistical Practice, and Loyola University Chicago's MS in Applied Statistics. Based on my background below, can anyone kindly let me know my chances or provide suggestions on how to improve them?

My background:

* BS Psychology with a Quantitative Skills concentration
* 4.0 GPA but math background is somewhat wonky; I took both calc 1 and elementary statistics twice due to transferring (got A-'s for both the first round and A's the second time), calc 2 (A), and calc 3 (withdrew)
* I plan to take elementary probability, applied regression analysis, and intro to programming this year. Are these classes enough to show that I'm quantitatively competent? Should I try to take more stat courses or retake calc 3 (even though it's technically not a prereq for these programs)?

"What population mean should be assumed for confidence interval, when trying to estimate number of samples needed? After conducting an experiment with 2 outcomes, with observed proportion of successes = p and number of trials = n, the confidence interval is given by:

p +/- Z-score * sqrt( (p * (1 - p) / n) )

If instead, we are about to start an experiment that is known to have 2 outcomes, but we don't know about the proportion of successes or the number of trials that should be conducted, it is possible to reverse the above formula to get ""n"".

n = (Z-score / margin of error)^2 * p * (1 - p)

In the above equation, the margin of error can be chosen to be as small/big as desired. The Z-score can be looked up in tables. But what should p be assumed as?

Since p = 0.5 gives the highest value of n, it makes sense to assume the worst and choose that value.

But what if, due to domain knowledge / prior experience with similar experiments, one knows that the value of p will be in a particular range? For instance, this may be an advertisement click experiment and industry metrics are well known. To take a concrete example, we know that the best ad in the history of ads had a click rate of 0.02. Would it be correct to assume p to be 0.02 then?

TL;DR: while designing an experiment, how to pick value of prior probability in order to estimate number of samples required to set up confidence interval, given knowledge of previous such experiments? Is it good/bad practice to choose p based on previous experience or should p = 0.5 always be used?

Especially cheering my girl Arya on (taking away her warging was … the worst) until it was like what, why? 

But Natalie Dormer and the Great Sept getting blown us was absolutely as mind blowing to me as all the other twists that came before it. Like I rewound that at least five times with my jaw hanging open. 

The fact that there was no mention of it again. No acknowledgement of the power vacuum with the lords and head of the main religion.

I assume Cersi is somewhat happy Joffery died, she wanted to be in control and I doubt he'd ever allow it, Cersi wouldn't have been able to manipulate him like she does Tommen and making orders behind Jofferys back wouldn't have been tolerated. 

6 episodes in and still nothing about bran.

I genuinely thought Sansa would be able to break reeks brainwashing. 

I hope Stannis can take the north but if this show has taught me anything it's that everyone is on chopping block and anything is possible (he did not. I believed in him and he fumbled everything.)

Is the red haired lady full of shit? She's done 1 thing that proves her reliable, creating the shadow but she either can't or won't bring back the dead. She's ruined Stannis life and I'm starting to doubt her, his daughter was killed for nothing because of her manipulation.

Is Arya gonna stay blind or will the god of many faces heal her?

Seeing Cersi humiliated was great, I only wish the humiliation would humble her but I don't think it will 

I knew Jon wouldn't have a hero's death but I'm hoping be does. I'm hoping the red haired lady can save him, she claims to see the future and we've seen people that practice her religion have been brought back before.

"Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months [D] In this thread, I address common missteps when starting with Machine Learning.

In case you're interested, I wrote a whole article about this topic: [Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months](https://towardsdatascience.com/study-plan-for-learning-data-science-over-the-next-12-months-8345669346c1)

Let me know your thoughts on this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/emg20nzhet661.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf09e4dc5e82ba2fd7b57c706ba2873be57fe8de

We are ending 2020 and it is time to make plans for next year, and one of the most important plans and questions we must ask is what do we want to study?, what do we want to enhance?, what changes do we want to make?, and what is the direction we are going to take (or continue) in our professional careers?.

Many of you will be starting on the road to becoming a data scientist, in fact you may be evaluating it, since you have heard a lot about it, but you have some doubts, for example about the amount of [job offers that may exist in this area](https://www.datajobs.dev/), doubts about the technology itself, and about the path you should follow, considering the wide range of options to learn.

I’m a believer that we should learn from various sources, from various mentors, and from various formats. By sources I mean the various virtual platforms and face-to-face options that exist to study. By mentors I mean that it is always a good idea to learn from different points of view and learning from different teachers/mentors, and by formats I mean the choices between books, videos, classes, and other formats where the information is contained.

When we extract information from all these sources we reinforce the knowledge learned, but we always need a guide, and this post aims to give you some practical insights and strategies in this regard.

To decide on sources, mentors and formats it is up to you to choose. It depends on your preferences and ease of learning: for example, some people are better at learning from books, while others prefer to learn from videos. Some prefer to study on platforms that are practical (following online code), and others prefer traditional platforms: like those at universities (Master’s Degree, PHDs or MOOCs). Others prefer to pay for quality content, while others prefer to look only for free material. That’s why I won’t give a specific recommendation in this post, but I’ll give you the whole picture: **a study plan**.

To start you should consider the time you’ll spend studying and the depth of learning you want to achieve, because if you find yourself without a job you could be available full time to study, which is a huge advantage. On the other hand, if you are working, you’ll have less time and you’ll have to discipline yourself to be able to have the time available in the evenings, mornings or weekends. Ultimately, the important thing is to meet the goal of learning and perhaps dedicating your career to this exciting area!

We will divide the year into quarters as follows

* **First Quarter**: Learning the Basics
* **Second Quarter**: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge
* **Third Quarter**: A Real World Project — A Full-stack Project
* **Fourth Quarter**: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice

# First Quarter: Learning the Basics

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u7t9bthket661.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad29cb43618e7acf793259243aa5a60a8535f0a

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study of the bases. It could be something like: From January 1 to March 30, 2021 as deadline. During this period you will study the following:

## A programming language that you can apply to data science: Python or R.

We recommend Python due to the simple fact that approximately [80% of data science job offers ask for knowledge in Python](https://www.datajobs.dev/en/home/data-science-jobs-open). That same percentage is maintained with respect to the real projects you will find implemented in production. And we add the fact that Python is multipurpose, so you won’t “waste” your time if at some point you decide to focus on web development, for example, or desktop development. This would be the first topic to study in the first months of the year.

## Familiarize yourself with statistics and mathematics.

There is a big debate in the data science community about whether we need this foundation or not. I will write a post later on about this, but the reality is that you **DO** need it, but **ONLY** the basics (at least in the beginning). And I want to clarify this point before continuing.

We could say that data science is divided in two big fields: Research on one side and putting Machine Learning algorithms into production on the other side. If you later decide to focus on Research then you are going to need mathematics and statistics in depth (very in depth). If you are going to go for the practical part, the libraries will help you deal with most of it, under the hood. It should be noted that most job offers are in the practical part.

For both cases, and in this first stage you will only need the basics of:

* **Statistics (with Python and NumPy)**

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Inferential Statistics
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Probability

* **Mathematics (with Python and NumPy)**

1. Linear Algebra
2. Multivariate Calculation

**Note**: We recommend that you study Python first before seeing statistics and mathematics, because the challenge is to implement these statistical and mathematical bases with Python. Don’t look for theoretical tutorials that show only slides or statistical and/or mathematical examples in Excel/Matlab/Octave/SAS and other different to Python or R, it gets very boring and impractical! You should choose a course, program or book that teaches these concepts in a practical way and using Python. Remember that Python is what we finally use, so you need to choose well. **This advice is key so you don’t give up on this part, as it will be the most dense and difficult**.

If you have these basics in the first three months, you will be ready to make a leap in your learning for the next three months.

# Second Quarter: Upgrading the Level: Intermediate Knowledge

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y1y55vynet661.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3e12bb112943025c39a8975faf4d64514df275

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From April 1 to June 30, 2021 as deadline.

Now that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics and mathematics, it is time to move forward and learn about the great advantages that Python has for applying data analysis. For this stage you will be focused on:

## Data science Python stack

Python has the following libraries that you should study, know and practice at this stage

* **Pandas**: for working with tabular data and make in-depth analysis
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: for data visualization

Pandas is the in-facto library for data analysis, it is one of the most important (if not the most important) and powerful tools you should know and master during your career as a data scientist. Pandas will make it much easier for you to manipulate, cleanse and organize your data.

## Feature Engineering

Many times people don’t go deep into Feature Engineering, but if you want to have Machine Learning models that make good predictions and improve your scores, spending some time on this subject is invaluable!

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data using data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself. To achieve the goal of good feature engineering you must know the different techniques that exist, so it is a good idea to at least study the main ones.

## Basic Models of Machine Learning

At the end of this stage you will start with the study of Machine Learning. This is perhaps the most awaited moment! This is where you start to learn about the different algorithms you can use, which particular problems you can solve and how you can apply them in real life.

The Python library we recommend you to start experimenting with ML is: scikit-learn. *However it is a good idea that you can find tutorials where they explain the implementation of the algorithms (at least the simplest ones) from scratch with Python, since the library could be a “****Black Box****” and you might not understand what is happening under the hood. If you learn how to implement them with Python, you can have a more solid foundation*.

If you implement the algorithms with Python (without a library), you will put into practice everything seen in the statistics, mathematics and Pandas part.

These are some recommendations of the algorithms that you should at least know in this initial stage

* **Supervised learning**  
Simple Linear Regression  
Multiple Linear Regression  
K-nearest neighbors (KNN)  
Logistic Regression  
Decision Trees  
Random Forest
* **Unsupervised Learning**  
K-Means

**Bonus**: if you have the time and you are within the time ranges, you can study these others

* **Gradient Boosting Algorithms**  
GBM  
XGBoost  
LightGBM  
CatBoost

**Note**: do not spend more than the 3 months stipulated for this stage. Because you will be falling behind and not complying with the study plan. We all have shortcomings at this stage, it is normal, go ahead and then you can resume some concepts that did not understand in detail. The important thing is to have the basic knowledge and move forward!

*If at least you succeed to study the mentioned algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning, you will have a very clear idea of what you will be able to do in the future*. So don’t worry about covering everything, remember that it is a process, and ideally you should have some clearly established times so that you don’t get frustrated and feel you are advancing.

So far, here comes your “theoretical” study of the basics of data science. Now we’ll continue with the practical part!

# Third Quarter: A Real World Project — A Full-stack Project

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vrn783vqet661.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=664061b3d33b34979b74b10b9f8a3d0f7b8b99ee

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the intermediate level. It could be something like: From July 1 to September 30, 2021 as deadline.

Now that you have a good foundation in programming, statistics, mathematics, data analysis and machine learning algorithms, it is time to move forward and put into practice all this knowledge.

Many of these suggestions may sound out of the box, but believe me they will make a big difference in your career as a data scientist.

## The first thing is to create your web presence:

* *Create a Github (or GitLab) account, and learn Git*. Being able to manage different versions of your code is important, you should have version control over them, not to mention that having an active Github account is very valuable in demonstrating your true skills. On Github, you can also set up your Jupyter Notebooks and make them public, so you can show off your skills as well. This is mine for example: [https://github.com/danielmoralesp](https://github.com/danielmoralesp)
* *Learn the basics of web programming*. The advantage is that you already have Python as a skill, so you can learn Flask to create a simple web page. Or you can use a template engine like Github Pages, Ghost or Wordpress itself and create your online portfolio.
* *Buy a domain with your name*. Something like myname.com, myname.co, myname.dev, etc. This is invaluable so you can have your CV online and update it with your projects. There you can make a big difference, showing your projects, your Jupyter Notebooks and showing that you have the practical skills to execute projects in this area. There are many front-end templates for you to purchase for free or for payment, and give it a more personalized and pleasant look. Don’t use free sub-domains of Wordpress, Github or Wix, it looks very unprofessional, make your own. Here is mine for example: [https://www.danielmorales.co/](https://www.danielmorales.co/)
* *Add all the exercises and projects you have done so far, in the previous 6 months, to your online portfolio*. You already have material to make yourself known, no matter how professional your Jupyter Notebooks look. My Jupyter Notebooks for now I’m uploading them here: [https://www.narrativetext.co/](https://www.narrativetext.co/)

## Choose a project you are passionate about and create a Machine Learning model around it.

The final goal of this third quarter is to create **ONE** project, that you are passionate about, and that is **UNIQUE** among others. It turns out that there are many typical projects in the community, such as predicting the Titanic Survivors, or predicting the price of Houses in Boston. Those kinds of projects are good for learning, but not for showing off as your **UNIQUE** projects.

If you are passionate about sports, try predicting the soccer results of your local league. If you are passionate about finance, try predicting your country’s stock market prices. If you are passionate about marketing, try to find someone who has an e-commerce and implement a product recommendation algorithm and upload it to production. If you are passionate about business: make a predictor of the best business ideas for 2021 :)

As you can see, you are limited by your passions and your imagination. ***In fact,*** ***those are the two keys for you to do this project: Passion and Imagination***.

However don’t expect to make money from it, you are in a learning stage, you need that algorithm to be deployed in production, make an API in Flask with it, and explain in your website how you did it and how people can access it. This is the moment to shine, and at the same time it’s the moment of the greatest learning.

You will most likely face obstacles, if your algorithm gives 60% of Accuracy after a huge optimization effort, it doesn’t matter, finish the whole process, deploy it to production, try to get a friend or family member to use it, and that will be the goal achieved for this stage: **Make a Full-stack Machine Learning project.**

By full-stack I mean that you did all the following steps:

* You got the data from somewhere (scrapping, open data or API)
* You did a data analysis
* You cleaned and transformed the data
* You created Machine Learning Models
* You deployed the best model to production for other people to use.

This does not mean that this whole process is what you will always do in your daily job, but it does mean that you will know every part of the pipeline that is needed for a data science project for a company. You will have a unique perspective!

# Fourth Quarter: Seeking Opportunities While Maintaining Practice

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qd0osystet661.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2da456b15985b2793041256f5e45bca99a23b51a

If you want to be more rigorous you can have start and end dates for this period of study at the final level. It could be something like: From October 1 to December 31, 2021 as deadline.

Now you have theoretical and practical knowledge. You have implemented a model in production. The next step depends on you and your personality. Let’s say you are an entrepreneur, and you have the vision to create something new from something you discovered or saw an opportunity to do business with this discipline, so it’s time to start planning how to do it. If that’s the case, obviously this post won’t cover that process, but you should know what the steps might be (or start figuring them out).

But if you are one of those who want to get a job as a data scientist, here is my advice.

## Getting a job as a data scientist

&gt;*“You’re not going to get a job as fast as you think, if you keep thinking the same way”.*  
*Author*

It turns out that all people who start out as data scientists imagine themselves working for the big companies in their country or region. Or even remote. It turns out that if you aspire to work for a large company like data scientist you will be frustrated by the years of experience they ask for (3 or more years) and the skills they request.

Large companies don’t hire Juniors (or very few do), precisely because they are already large companies. They have the financial muscle to demand experience and skills and can pay a commensurate salary (although this is not always the case). The point is that if you focus there you’re going to get frustrated!

Here we must return to the following advise: ***“You need creativity to get a job in data science”***.

Like everything else in life we have to start at different steps, in this case, from the beginning. Here are the scenarios

* *If you are working in a company and in a non-engineering role you must demonstrate your new skills to the company you are working for*. If you are working in the customer service area, you should apply it to your work, and do for example, detailed analysis of your calls, conversion rates, store data and make predictions about it! If you can have data from your colleagues, you could try to predict their sales! This may sound funny, but it’s about how creatively you can apply data science to your current work and how to show your bosses how valuable it is and **EVANGELIZE** them about the benefits of implementation. You’ll be noticed and they could certainly create a new data related department or job. And you already have the knowledge and experience. The key word here is **Evangelize**. Many companies and entrepreneurs are just beginning to see the power of this discipline, and it is your task to nurture that reality.
* *If you are working in an area related to engineering, but that is not data science*. Here the same applies as the previous example, but you have some advantages, and that is that you could access the company’s data, and you could use it for the benefit of the company, making analyses and/or predictions about it, and again **EVANGELIZING** your bosses your new skills and the benefits of data science.
* *If you are unemployed (or do not want, or do not feel comfortable following the two examples above)*, you can start looking outside, and what I recommend is that you look for technology companies and / or startups where they are just forming the first teams and are paying some salary, or even have options shares of the company. Obviously here the salaries will not be exorbitant, and the working hours could be longer, but remember that you are in the learning and practice stage (just in the first step), so you can not demand too much, you must land your expectations and fit that reality, and stop pretending to be paid $ 10,000 a month at this stage. But, depending of your country $1.000 USD could be something very interesting to start this new career. Remember, you are a Junior at this stage.

***The conclusion is: don’t waste your time looking at and/or applying to offers from big companies, because you will get frustrated. Be creative, and look for opportunities in smaller or newly created companies***.

## Learning never stops

While you are in that process of looking for a job or an opportunity, which could take half of your time (50% looking for opportunities, 50% staying in practice), you have to keep learning, you should advance to concepts such as Deep Learning, Data Engineer or other topics that you feel were left loose from the past stages or focus on the topics that you are passionate about within this group of disciplines in data science.

At the same time you can choose a second project, and spend some time running it from end-to-end, and thus increase your portfolio and your experience. If this is the case, try to find a completely different project: if the first one was done with Machine Learning, let this second one be done with Deep learning. If the first one was deployed to a web page, that this second one is deployed to a mobile platform. Remember, creativity is the key!

# Conclusion

We are at an ideal time to plan for 2021, and if this is the path you want to take, start looking for the platforms and media you want to study on. Get to work and don’t miss this opportunity to become a data scientist in 2021!

So far, we have a java program that given an image, tracks the object correctly. We are using an axis network camera to track objects, but we are running into issues with latency, and I was curious if you guys had suggestions for USB cameras that are good for vision processing. 

We are using 3 led light rings in front of the camera to track retroreflective tape on goals. Our primary considerations are low latency and linux support (jetson tk1 or jetson tx1).

Anyone know of a good camera for this? Thanks :) ",data science

"[SPOILERS] DISCUSSION Book/show discrepancy. Recently I have been reading through the GOT books to see how they compare to the show and I got to the part where Sansa learns how the hound had his face burned. 

This scene struck me as it's one of the most intense few pages of literature i have ever read and was a fantastic way of developing the Hounds character with him drunkenly oversharing.

However a noticeable difference in the show is that instead of the hound telling his own story its littlefinger describing what happened to him. The first link is me reading the passage from the book and the second is the scene from the show, for refrence.

https://youtu.be/bRzQlSo0NWw

https://youtu.be/BKpId6tu7Lo

Adide from Little Fingers telling being a sub par second hand story as compared to the Hounds first hand recount of the situation, it makes no sense that littlefinger would know what happened in the first place. In the book, the Hound threatens Sansas life if she speaks to anyone of what he told her that evening, meaning this is something he doesn't want anyone to know of. I understand little finger has a network of spies but it seems that up to this point the only people that should know what happened are Sandor, Gregor and Sansa


Maybe im missing something but i can't understand why they had Little Finger tell this story in the show or why he would know about it in the first place.",game of thrones

"Oracle's 1060 Node Raspberry Pi Supercomputer Questions. I've often thought about building a massively scaled Raspberry Pi supercomputer similar to Oracle's cluster of 1060 Raspberry Pi's. However, how they were able to pull it off is way over my head right now.

The network switches they are using are Ubiquiti UniFi 48 port switches, presumably with 4 uplink ports. I have enough money to buy 5 of them but to cluster them together do I just daisy chain them using the uplink ports? Or should I connect 4 switches to a single switch? For example:

                     -------Switch1
                     |
                     -------Switch2

                     |
                     -------Switch4

I'm really hoping to achieve a 240 node cluster because that's all I can afford right now. But if I want to add another switch and 48 more nodes then do I just connect the new switch into 'Switch1'? Or let's say I buy 5 more switches, do I plug the first 4 into `Switch1` and the last one into `Switch2`? And keep daisy chaining them this way? But with this configuration, every node will be one the same network correct? Regardless of how many switches?

I went to school for networking but it's been about 10 years so simple things like this I forget.

Also, the power consumption of 5 switches and 240 nodes, what am I looking at here? And how exactly is Oracle keeping this beast of a cluster cool? 1060 nodes is a lot of heat to be generating.",data science

Yes, Devops will do most of the deployments and delivering tasks. But if we draw a Venn diagram considering ""Developer"" as one circle and ""Devops"" as another circle in real world, There will be always some intersection between the both.

So deployment and maintenance of the project can take potentially takes 25% portion of whole project. Please don't skip learning it in your ML/AI journey. It's worth learning it to become a good ML/AI engineer. Please just don't keep learning ML algorithms one after the another.!",data science

IIRC there were three spin-offs proposed, we now only have one, merchandise disappeared from shops almost overnight, and so on. HBO must have been spitting blood. I hope they can reboot with House of the Dragon, but it still means hugely expensive lost opportunities. 

I don't accept the argument that it had anything to do with favourite characters being killed - there were favourite characters being killed here there and anywhere all through - Ned Stark, Red Wedding, etc. 

IMO it was that the behaviour of **almost every** character in the last season defied the logic of the character build up leading to there. Yes, if it had had more episodes then it might have made more sense, but as it was it simply didn't.  Add that to people's ability to levitate from one end of the country to the other, nonsense like hiding in the crypt from dead people, and the weapons that were deadly in one episode and helpless in the next, and it simply destroyed one's belief in the fictional world created.

"[Spoilers] Season 5 Finale Wanted to make a thread about jon's ressurrection and the theories people had for how it will happen in the books. Firstly did people like the way it happened in the show? I dont remember Thorne taking part in it in books and felt like that was out of character for him to do so (though its been a long while).  He's a prick but betraying the Night's Watch goes against his beliefs. It also didn't make much sense. Killing Jon for letting wildlings in after it happened when there was nothing that could be done to change the decision was strange. In the books the mutiny happens for a variety of reasons including the pink letter. It actually seemed justified in the books. Not that Jon was doing anything wrong, but that both sides made alot of sense. Jon could not reasonably let his favorite younger sister be abused and the NIght's Watch could not reasonably allow him to march south with the wildlings. Like the red wedding and Ned's execution it was a series of mis-steps that got him killed, not 1 decision like the show. 

I also think the ressurrection itself will be different. Martin has said that Lady Stoneheart was created to show how coming back to life changes a person. I dont think Jon will continue being ""jon"" after he comes back. Part of me thinks that Melisandre needs Shireen to burn to bring Jon back since she uses burning as a source of power. Any other theories?

&#x200B;

btw just want to say that Liam Cunningham KILLED IT as Davos. His scenes really carry the show in its later seasons. Say what you want about D and D, but his lines are perfect.

"[SPOILERS] What’s a scene that you can’t rewatch? What is an episode or scene you can’t or find hard to rewatch? (EMOTIONALLY. no one cares how much you hated certain seasons) 

Mine would definitely be the Red Wedding, although Shireen’s death is a close second... I honestly cannot ever sit through the Red Wedding scene again, I literally remember the first time I watched it. So excited thinking Arya gets a piece of her family back finally - but that scene was so long, silent (in terms of no background music and we know GoT can deliver on these), and extremely brutal. Not to mention how out of nowhere it was to increase shock factor, I genuinely felt me and my family had been betrayed 😂😂. Watching Rob, his wife and Cat die was agonising too, I couldn’t bare it if I was a mother in Cat’s position.

"Bayesian and Frequentist Confidence Intervals I can't see what's wrong with the probabilistic interpretation of confidence intervals in frequentist statistics.

One book about Bayesian Statistics says:

&gt; This is in stark contrast to the usual frequentist CI, for which the corresponding statement would be something like,
&gt;&gt; ""If we could recompute C for a large number of datasets collected in the same
way as ours, about (1−a)x100% of them would contain the true value of theta.""

&gt; This is not a very comforting statement, since we may not be able to even
imagine repeating our experiment a large number of times (e.g., consider an
interval estimate for the 1993 U.S. unemployment rate).

I really don't understand what's the problem. Who cares if we can't repeat the experiment in the real world? We're working with mathematical models anyway! I don't think it's possible to do inference without building some kind of model. Once you build a model and you made an assumption about how your data gets generated, then you can sample as many datasets as you want, can't you?",data science

"What's the mean of a normally-distributed random variable with known variance and state-dependent missingness (that's been binned)? This is a simplified version of a more complicated question I'm working on (fitting a phylogenetic multivariate ordinal probit model w/ MNAR sub-populaton-level observations), but I think this example captures the essential abstraction of the problem.

Let's say that I present to you the data encoded in [the following histogram](https://i.imgur.com/oGdCz2q.png)
and tell you that it was produced by binning values sampled from a normal distribution with unit variance into equally spaced bins of known location and width 0.5, and then discarding some amount of these data in an (unknown) state-dependent manner. The mean of the non-missing data is approx. 3.6. 

I want you to tell me the mean of the underlying normal distribution. What's the best way to do that? It seems like there's information in the asymmetry of the non-missing sample that can be exploited, no? What's the most principled way to obtain a point estimate of this unobserved mean (on the latent continuous scale -- in the real problem the data has been binned and individual observations on this scale have not been observed, but maybe you can ignore that detail if it makes things too complicated)?

[Here](https://pastebin.com/iV7qR6JH) is the R code used to generate the histogram above (where the function for producing the MNAR data is specified -- but in the inference problem it is unknown!).

"Using binary logistic regression and multinomial regression models in the same study My dependent variable asks whether people have a sense of victory or loss related to a local protest. I am interested in those who report ""loss,"" so I'd like to focus on this response. I have a series of independent variables identifying political philosophy of respondents. The problem is, about 40 percent responded ""difficult to define"" to the dependent variable question. So my original plans for binary logistic regression ""loss/victory"" are complicated. While multinomial regression makes sense statistically, I'm not sure that it quite reveals the story I am looking for.

So a colleague recommended I use both. For the first part, remove the 40 percent who said difficult to define and run the binary logistic regression as I had planned. She said that if multinomial models show that my independent variables have a similar result in the loss/victory part as my binary logistic models, then this validates my study.

Pragmatically, I guess I could go this route. She used this approach in another study with a similar dependent variable and received a revise and resubmit, with nobody taking issue with that.

Yet I struggle to justify it to myself. Is this really the best way to identify ""winners and losers"" with the debate?",data science

"Cross-validate dataset creation [Scikit-Learn] Maybe the title is a little bit misleading or incomplete, but I do not know how to frame it better. Bear with me with it for a second.

Assume a scene classification project has to be done. Images can not be fed into the classifier directly, so image features have to be created. There is a myriad of techniques in which one could do it. One of them is constructing what is called a Bag of Words (BoW). It could be created as follows:

1. Select a descriptor.
2. Slice all the images into patches and apply the descriptor to each one of them.
3. Once descriptors computed, fit a K-Means to them (the ""vocabulary"").
4. Apply that fitted K-Means to the previously computed descriptors and create a frequency histogram, the BoW.
5. Train a classifier on that BoW.

*(The above procedure may not be complete nor accurate, but illustrates the problem. Either way, feel free to correct me on that too.)*

By dataset creation I really wanted to mean all the process from the first up to the fourth step. And then we have the training of the classifier. So right now I see the whole procedure as being two step.

This problem has many hyper-parameters. During the dataset creation we could tune the size of the patch, the number of clusters (words in our vocabulary), apply multiple descriptors... And during training we could tune those related to the classifier itself.

I know that Scikit-Learn provides a really nice way to do hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV, for example. But due to my lack of experience I only see myself capable of applying it to the fifth step. First of all, is that desirable and therefore a good practice? Also, could it be possible to incorporate the dataset creation functions in a way that parameters could be set up by the GridSearchCV function?",data science

"[NO SPOILERS] I've seen the show end to end more than 10x. That being said, these 7 things seem to make me scratch my head and wonder, ""Does anyone else feel the same?"" As title suggests, GOT is my favorite show of all time. I've probably watched every episode between 10-20 times, as I play the series over and over in the background while I code. However, these 7 things drive me nuts--in no specific order--and I was just curious if anyone else shared these views or if I'm just bananas.

1. Character nicknames. Some just seem god-awful in that I don't think they'd ever be actual monickers IRL. Aegon - Egg,  Danarys- Dany, Baelish- Littlefinger. There are others. Sidenote... why does Baelish's voice grow creepier and creepier as the show progresses?
2. All of the screaming throughout every fight. I'm more than aware this is a shot towards realism, but it doesn't change the fact it becomes annoying. Obviously, Brienne takes the cake here.
3. Every time a dragon enters a scene, a chorus of men or women sing ""AAAAAHHHHHH ooooh AAAHHHHH"" in the background. Seriously?
4. The unnecessary and revolting desire to make the show as disgusting as possible at times. The winner is a draw between Mormont's pus turning into runny eggs and the lovely scenes in which we get to hear all the citadel's maester's take a dump in a 10-second span.
5. The excessive use of gore. Again, I'm aware this was Martin's desire for realism. It doesn't mean that we, as spectators have to see someone's entrails every episode.
6. The songs sung within the show. The Rains of Castemere, ""And now the rains weep o'er halls."" It just seems like the most pretentious line I've ever heard, maybe because I've heard it 10,000 times now? I really love the Bear and the Maiden Fair, ""From there to here, from here to there,"" or ""I've tasted the Dornishman's wife, ooooohhhh IIIIII've tasteeeddddd...."" ??? Why?
7. The fact that I can't read Martinn's prose. I've read over 100 fantasy fiction novels and my favorites I've read more than 10x each. Yet, I just can't stay focused enough to read his work. I can't make it 2 paragraphs without being pulled out of my imagination and saying to myself, ""What?

"[R] NEW Robustness Benchmark for 3D Point Cloud Recognition, ModelNet40-C. ""Benchmarking Robustness of 3D Point Cloud Recognition Against Common Corruptions"" Paper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12296](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12296) Github page: [https://github.com/jiachens/ModelNet40-C](https://github.com/jiachens/ModelNet40-C) Project page: [https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/modelnet40c](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/modelnet40c)

The authors create ModelNet40-C, a comprehensive dataset containing 185,100 point clouds from 40 classes, 15 corruption types, and 5  severity levels. The authors also provide a detailed taxonomy of the constructed corruption types. ModelNet40-C is a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking the ***corruption robustness*** of 3D point cloud classification.

[Sampled Visualization of ModelNet40-C from 15 Corruption Types.](https://preview.redd.it/svwclcu64ng81.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aebdc2ca728f9a19dbba802082cc776355634ad1)

Their benchmark and analysis have unveiled that despite the remarkable progress of 3D point cloud recognition models, their robustness against common corruption still requires significant considerations. There is a \~3x performance gap between ModelNet40 and ModelNet40-C.

[Performance Gap between Models on ModelNet40 and ModelNet40-C.](https://preview.redd.it/kd4fbbu64ng81.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=673bb974319813b48cfcdd9d945d7ca34c45ffe7)

The confusion matrix averaged from six models also cross-validates that ModelNet40-C still preserve the semantics of the original point clouds.

The authors also conducted in-depth analysis and summarized many useful insights. For example, they show that PointNet achieves strong performance on density corruptions, but fails on transformation corruptions due to its global feature-focusing design. Besides, Transformer-based design is more robust against corruption than others with proper training recipes.

"Is my undergrad thesis doable? Hiking GPS (GPX) segment interpolation using topographic data.  

Hi all,

I have started selecting a thesis for my undergrad. I did some ML/DS + visualisation last semester (nothing very complex - using keras and working with addMNIST data) and was interested in it so decided to expand on it during my final project.

I have been hiking a lot recently and sometimes loose GPS signal making my traces inaccurate. I came up with an idea to use earth relief data (available publicly) to interpolate intermediate point(s) that wouldn't be on the straight line and make more sense in terms of terrain. I would then use publicly available GPX interpolation software to improve the path.

I found some public GPX data from around 5k hikes and have seen some more of it available from other sources. The earth relief is also publicly available thanks to NASA in various accuracies (up to 1 arcsec) I think I would use autoencoders to learn the terrain around between every two points on these hikes (with hope that it would pick up on the slope) and then feed that as an input vector into a CNN with the output being offset for a middle point (offset from the straight line).

The GPS coordinates are recorded around every minute or two and for the training data I could remove some points to make it sparse and use those removed points as labels for learning. My minimal goal would be to improve accuracy by predicting the offset of at least one point but I guess it could be recursively applied if it's accurate.

I have about 2/3 moths for this and my supervisor is most likely not going to be of much help as he doesn't specialise in the area but gave me a green light for this if I'm confident. I might be able to get some help from another professor but it's most likely going to be minimal. I have not worked with this kind of data before and my knowledge of ML is at minimal undergrad level but I am really interested in the topic.

Do you think it's feasible undergrad final project for the timeframe given or am I likely oblivious to complexity of the project due to my inexperience?

TL;DR: Want to do a project on segmentation correction using terrain data but scared that I'm too inexperienced and fail.",data science

"[Spoilers] Why does Jaime get so much shit for being the Kingslayer I have been thinking this since I finished the series a couple of weeks ago.

I mean Im hundred percent sure Robert, even Ned would have killed him if Jaime just stalled enough and waited for Robert, Ned and their armies. I was also thinking that this series and franchise was created in the most realistic way possible, and deconstructing every major trop in sword and sorcery and fantasy storys is a reason Martin wrote the books and show war is not always about glory

 If this was any other story, Jaime would even be the King or at least have some claim because he killed the Mad King, the villain in that moment, and would be cherish by all the kingdom because in the end he did what was right. Or at least he would be the most cherished knight of the seven kingdoms. I remember even Tywin bust Jaime's balls for being the Kingslayer in a moment, dont remember in what episode exactly and he told him Aerys wanted his head and wanted to blow up Kings Landing cause mad mad king is mad, but at that point didnt anyone of them expected Aerys would do some crazy thing like that?

"[Spoilers] Just Finished GoT and the ending was so bad  

Game of Thrones is one of my favorite series, but season 8 as a whole was.. not good. So completely rushed and so many nonsensical moments. As a very big fan, it was really sad to witness. The worst thing about the final season however, is not that it was bad in itself, but that it retroactively makes the WHOLE show worse. Before season 8 came out, I was planning on rewatching the entire series from start to finish this summer vacation, but now I just.. don't have the desire to do so anymore. Season 8 makes so, so many plotlines entirely useless.

* The White walkers. This plotline is definitely the one that suffered the most. Introduced in the prologue to the entire show, and always hyped up to be THE supernatural main threat, they were just laughably easy defeated. How can you still be invested in this plotline, when you know the white walkers will all die without bringing about the mythical 'Long Night', without even properly getting into Westeros?
* Jon's Targaryen heritage.. I'm not saying he should have ended up as the King in the end, but him being a Targaryen should have had SOME impact, aside from turning Daenerys mad. How can you still get goosebumps during the 'cut from Baby Jon to grown up Jon' in the 'Winds of Winter', knowing his Targaryen heritage and general arc will lead to nothing? Or his epic stare-down with the Night King in Hardome, which also lead to absolutely nothing..
* The endings for Jaime, Daenerys, Bran, etc.. will also lessen the impact of their storylines. Is Jaime's redemption storyline going to be as good during a rewatch, knowing he will just end up with Cersei in the end and die with her? Is watching Daenerys trying to be a good ruler in Mereen for 3 seasons going to be interesting again, knowing she will die as a cartoon villain after destroying King's Landing? And what even is the point of Bran's storyline, if you know he will end up doing literally nothing (and being proclaimed King doesn't really count, because that has never even once been foreshadowed).

There are many more examples, but these are to my mind the biggest ones. And I'm really not bashing on the show, I love this series so much. But I can't shake the feeling that season 8 retroactively ruined a lot of the show.. I will certainly rewatch it again sometime in the future, but I fear it will never be the same again, and not in a good way..",game of thrones

A different source - a Wiki in my language - wrote that Tommen was 19 in season 6. I can not imagine that.

I find it weird because other guessings of the age seemed to be pretty acurate, telling that for example Bran was 17 in season 8 or that Margaery was 14 at the beginning of the series (meaning she was 20 in season 6).

"Interpretation of a model - could someone check my reasoning Question : https://i.imgur.com/j8WiNtx.png

Model 1 : https://i.imgur.com/vMFfY1k.png

model 2 : https://i.imgur.com/8zlVZq9.png

***********

## ratio of median surv. times of non diabetics to diabetics 

ratio of median: exp( -0.91 ) = 0.40 

Interpretation : the median survival times of diabetics are 0.4 times that of non diabetics 

## 95 % C.I. interpretation 

C.I found from exponentiating the C.I. limits in the output 

exp( -2 ) , exp( 0.17 ) gives 

lower = 0.14 , upper = 1.18 

This would suggest that we're 95% confident that the true ratio of the median survival times between diabetics and non diabetics is between (0.14, 1.18)

Given that the coefficient wasn't' significant at the 5% level (p = 0.1) it's not surprising 1 is contained in the conf. interval 

## risk ratio for patients with / without diabetes 

risk ratio is computed as exp( -shape * coef ) = exp( -0.45 * -0.91 ) = 1.51

This means that the risk of diabetics dying is around 50% more than non diabetics 

## weibull model behind model 2

Weibull model for model 2 is : 

    ln( mu_i ) = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 

where x1 = diabetes (0 if non diabetic 1 if diabetic) and x2 = AGE (continuous)

Here neither variable is significant at a 5% level, with Diabetes p = 0.189 and Age p value = 0.058

## risk ratio for patients with / without diabetes model 2

Risk ratio for patients with / without diabetes for model 2 is exp(-0.73 * -0.45) = 1.38

In model 2 the risk of death is around 38 % greater for diabetics than non diabetics having adjusted for AGE

## interpretation of the coefficient of AGE

Given the low value of the AGE coefficient it may be best interpreted in terms of 10 years. 

exp( 10 * -0.034 ) = 0.71

This suggests that the survival time is 0.71 times that of someone 10 years younger.

For example, if I have N images (all same width and height), I want my network to make an output regardless of the number of images I have. Ideally, the more images I have, the better my network's prediction will be (because it will have more data).

I don't want an RNN or any locality between the images.

"Comment How can you have a 'hero' and 'villain' in a very morally grey world.

Starks could be argued that they are dishonourable traitors to the Crown itself. Which were the Targaryens they deposed a few decades earlier in Robert's Rebellion. Then now they are doing the exact same thing, deposing the incest boy Joffrey. Also ignoring, the one true king and lawful heir to Robert Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon. They don't support his claim at all, despite the close relationship of the Baratheons and Starks.

They break their fealty like two times.

They were close to chopping off Jaime Lannister's head off. Which Tywin saw as his heir and successor naturally. I would say he was ruthless in maintaining the balance of power that his family occupied. If he lost against the North and other claimants, he might lose his head.

I don't think he says this in the books, but he says in the show to Arya.

"Building intuition and understanding for image moments I'm having a difficult time understanding image moments. Specifically, what are all of them, and where and for what are they useful? I undertand m00, m01, m10, and some applications. But others, like m11, m21, mu21, nu12, etc. - ???

I understand how moments have been calculated. I just don't always understand what each one is, what they're for, how to apply them, etc.

Is there a 'cheat sheet' anywhere that says something like: 'm00' is area; 'm01/m00' is the centre Y coordinate, 'm10/m00' is the centre x coordinate, etc., but for all image moments?

Can anyone please point me to some good clear resources that define what each image moment is actually capturing, and some examples of application.

"Junior Developer Vs RPA Developer As a recent computer science graduate. I have worked for a law firm as a junior developer for about a year now. I am ready to take another challenge so I started applying for other jobs. 

Here’s the catch, I have an interview for a Rpa development role. But I also have another junior development job interview

Not really sure which position I should take. I have been reading about Rpa development. Doesn’t seem like there is a lot of coding in this career. Also, this career seems to be fairly new and idk if it will be worth it in the long run. I would be making way more money than my current job. 

On the other hand, I have an interview for another junior developer position. Making almost double the money that I am making now. Sounds like a good gig. I would be doing  development in the .net which is what I been doing for the past year in my current job. 

I guess my question is. Which job would you guys choose?

I would like to know the pros and cons of both career paths. I would appreciate it if you guys gave me some advice.

Thank you. 

P.S.
The reason why I am leaving my current job is because there is no room for growth in the company and the pay is extremely shitty.

- Daenerys is sold into sexual slavery to a warlord that rapes her every night... until she learns to take control in the bedroom and falls in love with him. His death is portrayed as tragic, even though its a start of Dany's own rise to power, and she continues to remember him fondly after that.

"Comment I've seen a lot of people here trying to justify Tywin, my dudes, Tywin was brutal. He mass murder people before the series even started (like the sac of Kings Landing) and even order the killing of children just so they won't be a 'threat' and it's not like his brutality slowed down. He was one of the main architects of the red wedding and even made plans to have his own son murder. Tywin likely has more blood on his hands than any other character.

Some of the justifications I've seen is something like 'everyone else did that stuff'. NO. There are other villains in the series but the idea that Ned, the Starks, or several other houses are just as bad as Tywin is frankly ridiculous. Stop making this point.

We understand his motives, gaining and keeping power with an obsession with his legacy (family legacy as an extension of that). But, understanding his motives is not a justification for his actions.

At Tywin's funeral, serval characters note how bad he smells. The is a metaphor for what Tywin's legacy really is. If you think Tywin isn't a villain or that there was some good in his actions your missing the point.",game of thrones
"Lead Scoring Model for Marketing Hi There,

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently been going through tutorials on creating multi-touch markov attribution models in R ([here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aB8Nit7iY7YJ:https://analyzecore.com/2016/08/03/attribution-model-r-part-1/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us)).

&amp;#x200B;

From this I've created a set of users (about 100,000) that have a path to whether they converted or not. Some users may even have multiple conversions. For example:

User 1: a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; a &gt; conversion

User 2: a &gt; a &gt; c

User 3: c &gt; b &gt; a &gt; a &gt; conversion

User 4: a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; &gt; c

These users have followed different paths with touch points in various marketing channels (a, b, c) to either converting or potentially dropping from their search. I also created the time between each touchpoint. So for example, my dataset has:

User 1:  
a &lt;- 2019-04:01 12:00:00

b &lt;- 2019-04:03 11:23:11

c &lt;- 2019-04:03 06:23:19

a &lt;- 2019-04:06 18:23:11

conversion &lt;- 2019-04:06 19:00:22

  
I've been trying to find  a source on lead scoring models in machine learning but haven't really had any luck.

I've been thinking of using the transition matrix from that, the number of days in the path, and the number of touch points to assign a sort of lead score, but it all seems sort of arbitrary.

Is there some way to analyze the entire paths of every user and predict how close they are to converting?

Let's say a conversion is 1. I don't really have labels for non-converting users since when they don't convert their just sort of in an indeterminate state.

  
Can anyone point me in some sort of direction on this? I'm a bit lost!

VOTE HERE: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScM4tANOK2XDIP_vigjtzvlWXgsbalU-3ZwGInL0iITfsmiXg/viewform?usp=sf_link

VIEW THE FULL DRAW HERE: https://challonge.com/thereddittourneyqfs.svg

The numbers shown in the draw represent the percentage of total votes. There were 117 responses for round 3.

A few notes:

The draw is comprised of all the main characters, as per the wikipedia page, plus some others. Sorry if i've missed out anyone else you'd have liked to have seen but i needed to keep it to 64 entrants in order to avoid byes in the draw. Apart from spacing out some of the obviously best fighters the draw has been randomised.

Some characters fighting abilities change a lot over the course of the show (eg J Lannister or Arya) or were more renowned fighters in the lore of the show but it's not shown on screen (Robert Baratheon), in these cases feel free to choose whichever version of that character you like.

They can use whatever weapon, like how in the Mountain vs the Viper they could turn up with whatever weapon they liked, but...

NO MAGIC! It may be worth doing a tourney in the future that includes magic if this one goes well but for now we wont allow magic because it just confuses things.

"How to create ""Representative"" curves?  I build audio equipment and I have frequency response data for hundreds of devices.  There appear to be systematic differences among the devices. I want to develop a small number (about ten) of “representative” response curves based on this data and then categorize the devices into one of the groupings (Device #xyz falls in to type A, B, C,…).  These representative curves should all fit within the historical data set, but each representative curve should be statistically different from the other representative curves.  How would I determine these curves? In other words, how do I take hundreds of curves and boil them down into a smaller number of curve types or groupings? 

My initial thoughts are I need to split the frequency response into frequency bands and determine an amplitude range for each one of those bands.  So, if I have 5 frequency bands and a high, medium and low amplitude range for each of those bands, I will have 125 (5\^3) curves.  However, this assumes the bands are completely independent from  one another. Like I said, there *appear* to be systematic differences in the data.

"MS dissertation help I am comparing scores before and after a group therapy intervention, and would like to plot the pre- and post-means and standard deviations of several measures on a line graph.

But, different measures have different ranges (e.g., some go from 0-60 whilst others go from 0-10), so plotting them on the same graph would minimise the changes.

"[D] Choosing an algorithm dealing with different label input shape sizes and creating a generalized regression model Hey everyone,

Disclaimer:  I’m not totally new to Machine Learning, I have witnessed some projects  and I’m generally informed with how it all works but I never applied it  myself.

Anyway, I have a Machine Learning problem and because of the properties of the problem I’m not sure what algorithm to use.

I’m trying to predict the travel time of an object.

Each  trip is time-series labelled (infrequent due to detection and sensor  placement) and consists out of one or more data points (records in my  dataset). Each record contains geospatial information about the object.

Basically,  the dataset consists out of tons of records of which one or more  records belong to one trip exclusively. Each new trip is marked with a  unique ID. They are all important since they contain information such as  geospatial data.

Connecting all  the data points of each trip ID will generate a “path”. However, some  trips in the dataset only have one data point but with a known start and  end point. This means a path cannot be constructed from those records.

I  have created labels by finding certain conditions that should be met.  Each label consists at least out of two records. This means a lot of  information in between does not have to be present, as long as the  object was observed close to the start and ending point, it can be  considered a label and the total travel time can be estimated. It can  also mean that a trip with a lot of data points but with no data points  close to the start and end location of the object cannot be considered a  label.

I have added additional  features like the distance to the previous point in km and total trip  distance in km (float values). Most features describe the relationship  to the previous data point.

In summary:

For  the prediction labels: at least know the total distance the object will  travel and I will have at least one data point with geospatial  information in between this start location and end location.

For  the training labels: at least I will have two data points with  geospatial information close to start and end location together with the  total travel time.

Ideally I want  to predict the travel time for each trip with one or more data points  (records). I’m not trying predict/construct the path taken. Just an  estimate for the travel time.

The problem is, is that I’m not sure what algorithm to use since:

* I  have multiple records that belong to one record. So far I haven’t  really come across how to deal with a variable input shape size. Most  say to reduce the input shape size to a single record/row (I would call  it “flattening”) by binning values or one-hot encoding values.
* “Flattening  the features” is not really possible. The added depth of the  additionally computed features would be lost by binning since they  provide insight about how it is connected to the previous data point  (distance).
* A  trip can be represented by simply one record in the database or by a  lot of records. The greater the record count, the better. Some trips  have consists out of 50 records which allow for a better estimate.

I  was thinking of a Recurrent Neural Network since they can deal with a  time-series sequence but I’m questioning it can be applied tot his  problem.

Can I train a Recurrent  Neural Network on a lot of groups (trips in this case) and generate a  generalized model that I can use to predict other groups? Or can it only  make prediction within each group? I have a lot of trips (groups) but  the available information per trip (group) is very limited in most  cases. I therefore want to develop a generalized model that will work  for all groups.",data science

"Bayesian network: graph synthesis &amp; data sampling **Input (What I have):** some Bayesian networks (both graph structure and conditional probability distribution (cpd)) and corresponding **categorical** datasets (e.g. [bnlearn repo](https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/)).

**Output (What I want):** synthesize graphs and datas so that they're *similar* to the given dataset. In terms of *similar*, I’m referring to the generalization from synthetic data to the given dataset, on properties like graph structure bias, cpd bias, conditional independence test value bias, etc.

**How (What I have done):**
 - Graph synthesis: use Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert model to generate skeleton, then randomly orient to DAG.
 - Data sampling: I’ve tried two methods:
     + SEM: numerical value from linear or non-linear model. Then assign random cardinalities to nodes, and digitize them (uniformly bin-cut from min to max).
     + forward sampling: Need to randomly generate cardinalities, and each node’s cpd using Dirichlet distribution.

**Why (Problems I have met:)**
Simulated data failed to generalize well to the testset (given dataset). Separate the two steps and see why:
+ Graph: re-sample the data from graphs of the given dataset, but using my new sampling parameters. It works well.
+ Data: so problem is on data sampling procedure (or is this induction wrong?)
    - SEM: is there any better way to make sample data (e.g. SEM parameters, discretizing method).
    - forward sampling: For a node $X_i$ and a possible value combination $pa_i$ of its parents $PA_i$, $P(X_i|PA_i=pa_i)$ is assigned by a Dirichlet distribution $Dir(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_{n_i})$, where $n_i$ is cardinality of $X_i$ and $\alpha_1=\cdots=\alpha_{n_i}, ~U[0.1,1.2]$. This random assignment to cpd will then be repeated for each possible value combination (for $\Pi_{j\in PA_i}{n_j}$ times).
        + Is this a good way of forward sampling? Is there any better way in fine-tuning $\alpha$ parameter in Dirichlet distribution? I’ve tried to use MLE to estimate the $\alpha$ form the given dataset’s cpd, but failed to converge.

"Classifiers for Page Numbers Sequences Ihave a dataset which  has the following columns : Document id and page numbers and labels.

|document2|22 34 56 67|mystery|

|document 4|12 32|myster|

Explaining my table  below: 

Row 1 corresponds to data for document 1:  document 1  starts from page 1 to 23 , then restarts from 26 to 45. It continues to 48 to 76 and ends. This  document 1 represents stories belonging  to class fiction 

Similarly  row2 has data corresponding to document 2: document 2 starts from page 22 to 34 and then restarts from 56to 67. This  document 2 represents stories belonging  to class  mystery and so on.

Aim. is to develop a classifier that can classify  a document to be of a particular category (fiction,mystery,science) based on the page numbers. 

I am looking for advice on what kind of classifiers i could use for classification a page number series. This isn't time series and hence i am a bit confused  whether i need to use complex algorithms like LSTM.Are there easier models that  can use series of data  such as  page  numbers as features?  

One thing that I am also considering doing is to introduce padding to the page numbers so that al the page numbers are of equal length. Not sure if padding is needed step for sequence classifiers.

"[Spoilers] Help me Rewrite Jason Mamoa #Warning: I might need to take a shit, where's my battle buddy???

#wounded warriors project 

So apparently Jason Mamoa has a much bigger impact on my sexual awakening as I thought...

He'd be the perfect unnamed vampire that becomes Xunolus boyfriend. I didn't like this guy so I didn't give him much character development.. however 2 big things 

The first book creates a narrative that taught me a very valuable lesson at 10, so while reading the book worried my father, he let it go when I pointed out that ""It's just the Bible but with zombies and dragons"" so he let it go 

However it opened up an incredible dialogue about consent that changed my life.

In the book she is 11 and he is 30. At 10 I didn't see a problem as Mary had Jesus at 14 so it's normal for a character like that.

While I didn't know what sex was, the scene of their wedding night was actually really romantic and taught me consent can happen even if you don't speak the same language you can still consent 

If you don't know the dialogue is exactly the same but it plays out like this...
He removes her clothing notices she is crying and wipes her tears while saying no. When he is done undressing her he distances himself saying no while removing his own clothing. He then removes his jewels and braids...finally he says No?

Then she approaches him, takes his hand, guided it to where she wanted...finally whispering yes 

The other scene with the dragon eggs was romantic too. While they are intimate, she isn't used to riding horses...so she wasn't crying or scared because she didn't want to, she really wanted to she was just really sore. She even starts thinking about how she wishes she could look at him while it was happening, but it's not the dothraki way. However, in this moment she appreciates the dothraki way right now because if he knew she was crying she knew he would stop and she ""wasn't done yet"" so she focuses on the dragon eggs at the same time to make sure he doesn't notice she's crying 

I was so excited for these scenes in because 1...she was already being molested by her brother who she assumed for a long time she would marry. Better to marry the evil she knows than this scary war tribe

2. While now that I'm an adult I understand this change was probably due to the fact that they had such a huge age gap...an 11 year old can not consent to a 30 year old so they probably where trying to tackle that issue, using the language barriers to rationalize it instead.

However, the solution was already there by closing the age gap. Instead, they rob her of the beauty of her wedding night, and the beauty of there sexual relationship and the biblical narrative that women can enjoy sex a lot if its done right 

As a 10 year old who hit puberty at 9. It was a scary time cuz suddenly everything changed and the boys wouldn't leave my boobies alone and I thought it was just another part of the ""eve curse"". I knew what sex was, but it wasn't something for a woman to enjoy, it was her duty to keep her man faithful and have his babies)

To further add to the story.. apparently when I was 5 I basically decided that I was going to part of his ""harem"" when I grew up...

Apparently I thought marriage was just a party you did when you want to be family/roommates cuz it's a sin to live with someone you're not married to so let's just say I had a really long with a clear top 4....

2 were from ""Hawaii baywatch"" a redhead and Jason mamoa. Every time I came home from from a bad day of school there were 3 shows I demanded to see  cuz I needed to see my husband's and wives let's just say, Steve urcle, Mario Lopez, Kokoum, Arielle, Gaston (as the butler) Jason Mamoa and a redhead extra I saw in some sort of baywatch, and another unknown girl from another show. 

Baywatch was particularly frustrating for him cuz I kept saying HAWAII BAYWATCH but he never knew what I meant cuz he never saw the redhead I was looking at and every time he asked where she was I'd say, your too late you already missed her in this episode 

But it was my obvious favorite and I didn't get way he was so confused when I asked for it all the time.

Then it was our ""first trip to Disney"" (he just told me it was an audition and he was kind of hoping I didn't get any part, but also didn't want to Sabatoge my dream if that's what I really did know I wanted for myself).

So when he asked if I was ready to see if I could be a Disney princess, I thought he meant that I was getting married and I was so excited about planning the wedding he couldn't stop me...so I begged him to get me ""All the ring pops"" so I can propose to my favorite characters!!!

Then we would live there and the men...(Gaston and John Smith) would make all the money and do all the cooking and cleaning while I married ""my prince charming"" (Jason Mamoa) and as many princesses I could find to make it ""more fun""

Fast forward to my teen years...and I can't remember the movie but again, he was there but Native American this time so while he was familiar I didn't recognize him...just thought the main characters daughter was really cute...then there's a scene where she meets him at a casino and they flirt every time her dad wasn't paying attention. While I remember the scene, I don't remember any details but my dad said I kept crying I kept doing it till I started crying and when he kept asking me why all I could say was ""I really don't get it but I know God is listening to my thoughts as I'm trying to figure it out...I'm pretty sure no matter what I do I'm going to hell.

Now that I'm an adult I see that 
1. He married a woman I can recognize and was on my list of potential princess candidates...

2. Now that I know it wasn't 3 guys but 1 Jason Mamoa 

3. He marries Daenerys in the show 

4. Now that I'm all grown up, he still causes me so much confusion. I don't know if I want to be him, try to purchase ""a big penis"" so I can fight him for the women in his life, or if I want to actually sleep with him myself

5. To make matters worse...I just had a thought and during the research I was doing I came across an interview about a ""fuzzy pink sock"" so now the idea of either fighting him or sleeping with him makes me want to pee my pants....

6. All I can say is if I were to ""get a big penis to compete with"" it would have to get an impossibly large one to compete...the nature of this concept makes me think of Cthulu...so yeah, my penis is Cthulu and it's bigger then Jason Mamoas and I get to keep my cool boobs...

So now I'm thinking of a story like this 
Xunolu is Vampire boys first wife (based on Jason Mamoas current irl wife)
Chrystalynn was originally a surface elf so while it was an attempt to save her life, the dark nature of vampire powers corrupted her natural life energy causing her to have an existential crisis that drove her to madness...she became terrorist #1because reality became distorted and enhanced her PTSD so she went into survival mode...

Since another issue I grew up with was being called Casper, albino, since I'm white but my dad is mixed but looks very black...we even got a DNA test to prove he actually was my father because I was positive I was either adopted or switched at birth because being in a multicultural household, where my brothers and I were the only white people there...so it's only natural for me to be the terrorist #2/kahleesi

So basically, Xunolu, Vampire are together and meet Kahleesi saving her life because she was the last human as there is a race war, but humans wiped themselves out because they were too busy waring over what human should have the iron thrown to know that terrorists were planning to make their move to overthrow humanity. Despite being saved, being human meant that she was immune to gaining any powers. Knowing that they decide to protect her, eventually forming a power throuple, which greatly extended her life...every time she ""dies"" they bite her to bring her back 

They decided to work together to win the Iron throne, making Xunolu head queen because she already naturally had dark magic that she had under control by being drow, but being also a vampire amplifies her dark magic so she is the most powerful of the 3

However, once in power it became clear they had very different versions of what paradise means 

Xunolu wants a strict military society (qunari/dragon age)

Vampire as an issue as it removes all forms of freedom including freedom of thought. He thought the solution was easy, turn everyone in the world into vampires and people would stop fighting...

Kahleesi argues it isn't that simple, as people would rather be free in chaos that prescribe to conformity in paradise....

But at the end of the day Xunolu was head queen and it was her decision. At first it was paradise. Everything was simple, no one had to think for themselves or worry about comfort and security 

But 1000 years later, terrorism happens because the people wanted ""give me liberty or give me death""

Vampire goes, that's my cue, death....
So he starts converting everyone thinking  the experience he had with crystalyn was just a rare fluke...but forcing creatures with natural light magic into vampires with dark magic caused insanity death and another long war...this time the vampires are all wiped out through genocide...

Kahleesi decides she just wants to die now, but for the first time...nothing works. Later realizes there's powerful magic in love and blood and she is possibly immortal 

She becomes ""Bran"" through her own strength but immediately burns the throne and introduces democracy before running away.  

Then she lives a quiet life as a bard, eventually creating the ""bards alliance/friends of Red Jenny""

As this alliance focuses on using The expressive arts  as a form of therapy and coping with all the war around us...

But as we got more and more famous as bards and an alliance , mental health issues were being tackled and while she ran as far as she could from her original country...

Her ideas changed the culture and diplomacy of the already diplomatic country she resides in ""Hawaii""

Then Hawaii takes over the world...not through power or strength, but through the Aloha Spirit. Finally lasting peace is obtained and she visits the grave, saying she never thought she would ever return. She is incredibly old at this point almost like a skeleton..no one even remembers who she is anymore but her stories and songs were taught to the current generation in school and she becomes a history professor in a small local town.

She tries one more time to kill herself, but it just ends up with her becoming young again...she laughs as she says, ""well I guess I somehow got stuck in the heaven you made for me, or maybe I am already dead...either way, I spend my time making sure people remember you for who you both really were...

And that's the end
Goodbye 

So now here is a song dedicated to all creators and entertainment...if you see this and have any ideas or pointers, especially with transitions because ""and suddenly we are fighting people in outerspace wouldn't work...

P.s. shout out to Rick and Morty for Jessica because now she is a time God and I'd be totally cool with them using my ideas for her arch...just be sure to #warning: I may need to take a shit soon, where's my battle buddy if you guys decide to use my ideas...maybe she could even become Rick's new nemesis in a weird way...or...if the theory that Rick and Morty are the same, maybe she really is alluding to the fact that she just saw the future and knows she's his grandma now...it would be fun to see them try to make that work

But here's the song...ps, Dan Harmon, since Harmonquest exists, I'd love if we could play d&d to improve the work of season 8 D&D....

So again... a song dedicated to fellow artists

Show me show me show me how you do that trick 

The one that makes me scream she said

The one that makes me laugh she said 

And threw her arms around my head

Show me how you do it!

And I promise you I promise you 

I'll run away with you 

I'll run away with you

Spinning on that Dizzy edge 
I kissed her face 
I kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow

Why are you so far away she said

How could you ever know 

That I'm inlove with you

I'm in love with you

You one and only 
You lost and lonely 
Resisting in the waters 

Your just like dream!
Your just like a dream!

Daylight licks me into shape 
I must have been asleep for days
In moving lips I breathe your name
And open up my eyes

I found myself alone alone alone above a raging sea
Who stole the only one I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You one and only 
You just like heaven

Murmaider Murmaider Murmaider 
Go into the water
Live there 
Die there 

We reject your land empires

Finally the hills are without eyes 
They were tired of watching a dead man's face
Red with their own blood..

They used to love
Having so much to lose
Close your just once and see everything in ruin

What's left to be alive???

Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever listen to a word we played 
Or did you just let the wrong things in

Did we get this high just feel your pain?
Did we play just to be pawns in your game?
How blind could you be don't you see 
You took the wrong road 
But we're here waiting 
Bye bye beautiful!

How blind can you be don't you see
How blind can you be don't you see

Did we get this high just to feel your pain?
Did we play just to be pawns in your game 
How blind can you be don't you see 
You took the wrong road but we'll be waiting 
Bye bye beautiful 
Bye by beautiful!

This beautiful tragedy
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny 
Take me away

Will you be there for me? Or will you be
The death of me 
Oh my Beautiful tragedy 

Silent nights 
Let me sleep away the memories within
Sacrifices of purity is turning me to sin
And this judgement day is growing near
And this confession
Is killing me again 

This beautiful tragedy 
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny 
Take me away....

My girl she's a column
In the million pages written 
Since the universe existed 
And every little piece of mind

She provides 
Just the strength I need 
Let's me breathe 
Let's me breath
Cuz 

I'm in love with a ghost 
Why don't you haunt me in my dreams 
Please possess me while I sleep so I could lock you up inside my head and never let you leave me here with my heart in my hands I'm here with my heart in my hands now 

Cuz yes your the star beneath the stairs 
Yes your my ghost upon the stage 
You are my everything 

Endless night
Tears are falling down 
But I'm still holding on
Finding strength I never knew
ILL WATCH YOU
AND TRY TO BE Like you!

You are my guiding star!

Lose ourselves in this and ignore

"[Q] How do we interpret 'vaccine efficacy'? I don't fully understand this short explainer I've read. https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jan/24/behind-the-numbers-what-does-it-mean-if-covid-vaccine-has-90-per-cent-eifficacy
&gt;**Imagine 100 people are ill with Covid-19. “90% efficacy” means if only they’d had the vaccine, on average only 10 would have got ill.** Vaccine efficacy is the relative reduction in the risk: whatever your risk was before, it is reduced by 90% if you get vaccinated. There is a lot of confusion about this number: it does not mean there is a 10% chance of getting Covid-19 if vaccinated – that chance will be massively lower than 10%.

I understand where they're coming from with efficacy being a relative reduction in the risk of (symptomatic?) illness. However, I don't understand their opening analogy (in bold); if 100 people are ill w/ Covid, then on average 10 would have got ill. But this ignores the distribution of risk of catching covid before the vaccine, i.e. of those 100, they could (say) all have a risk (across a given period) of 40% of catching Covid, and if it so happens they 100 people who have a risk of 40% caught it. If they have the vaccine, then their risk ~~would drop to 0% (40%-90% = -50%, or 0% if you want to interpret it correctly?).~~ would become 40% x 10% = 0.4 x 0.1 = 4%.

Is there an assumption made that the 100 who caught COVID in this example had a 100% of catching (symptomatic) COVID if not vaccinated?

Hopefully this makes sense - I'm just struggling w/ the analogy at the start.",data science

"[D] Best statistical/ ML approach to combine numerically simulated outcome and unstructured data? Hello all!

I have been assigned to a research project in collaboration with a manufacturing company who are looking to improve the accuracy of their model. Their research question is to **improve their Finite Element Analysis model (FEA) accuracy with statistical techniques/Machine learning methods.** What they are producing is high-end metal products and they are trying to improve the manufacturing process.

Basically they have raw material with specific properties (strength, weights, etc...) that they are heating at very high temperature and pressure which gives then the final product. The problem is that during the heating phase the product exhibits some shrinkage. **It is this shrinkage that they are trying to model.**

Their engineers have already developed an FEA model but it is not precise enough and is computationally really expensive. They believe that by leveraging the data they have been collecting over the past years (material type, the simulation results and other categorical variables) a hybrid/fusion model could be more precise and give faster predictions. As this is a research question, it does not have to be put into production, they are looking at a prototype framework that could be improve over the years.

I have the following information regarding the first set of data they sent me:

* The data is structured/tabular and contain lots of categorical variables
* The number of points is between 5000-10000 so not enough for a neural network approach.
* They have both the observed outcome (measured in the lab) and numerically simulated outcome (from the FEA).
* I do not have access to the FEA model so no simulation that I can run myself (hence no autoencoder approach to obtain some sort of surrogate model that I could have combine with the tabular data).

My question is then the following: **Given that the dataset is quite small and in a tabular form, is there any statistical methods that can do better than Tree-based models? Has anyone come across a similar problem? Is there any hybrid framework I could use to make the most of the numerically simulated outcome ?**

After days of researching the literature I have not be able to find anything on similar question.

**The idea would be to have the best of both worlds, a prediction constrained by physics-based boundaries while incorporating knowledge from the data to allow predictions in unexplored region due to the strict FEA assumptions.**

"[SPOILERS] Royce rolls over During Littlefinger's trial, Yohn Royce rejects Baelish's plea for support despite his position as Warden of the Vale. Understandable, given that Littlefinger is accused of murdering Lysa Arryn.

But he doesn't seem to have any reaction toward Sansa for her own part in Lysa Arryn's death and Littlefinger's rise to power in the Vale. Sansa had previously given direct testimony to him that Lysa had stepped through the moon door on her own, testimony which protected Littlefinger and ensured he was free to pull the strings in the Vale. Then at the trial Sansa changes the story to accuse Baelish of pushing her through.

Seeing Sansa governing smartly as lady of Winterfell, and learning that the testimony he saw was Sansa lying convincingly, I'd have thought he'd have started to doubt whether her testimony could so easily be explained away as being given under duress, and been a little more suspicious that she was a clever manipulator who'd been conspiring with Littlefinger, not an vulnerable child. 

I think if it were me in Royce's boots, I'd be a bit more wary about Sansa's actions after that, and certainly wouldn't be quite so keen for Robyn to accept her brother as King over the Vale while she takes the North independent.",game of thrones

"Greater difference but larger P value?? Thank you for taking the time to answer my query.
I am comparing ""before and after"" data from a two section questionaire of 10 questions. The total sample size is 46 which is constant for all questions on said questionaire. Each question on the questionnaire uses an arbitary scale from 1 to 10. 

I am calculating a paired T-test using GraphPad Prism.
 
For the 1st question the mean increased from 5.15 to 9.08, the one tailed P value was 0.0188 and the two tailed P value &lt;0.00001.

The 2nd question was similar, 4.69 to 9.18 and a one tailed P value of 0.0278, the two tailed P value was again &lt;0.00001

Now comes the confusing part, for the 3rd question the mean increases from 4.56 to 9.21 but the one tailed P value is 0.112?

There is a greater difference between the means for before and after, and the same sample size, yet the P value has gotten larger and hence a non significant result? whereas the others were?

on s1e2, he killed the butcher's son, just a kid, because of Joffrey. when I watched that episode, my opinion about him was that he was such a heartless bad guy.

as the seasons passed, I started liking and understanding him more. arya and brienne have a lot to do with him as well. they kinda shaped him to be who he was on the ending.

when he returned after almost dying in the fight with brienne I felt so happy. I also think that his death on ""the bells"" was very honorable.

"How to store preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline? Hi all,

I will soon start a project where I need to create a classification model from tabular data (both numeric and categorical). I would like to avoid the usual mess that occurs when you try multiple models in a rush (and we will be in a rush!) by creating a model archive on the cloud (S3 storage) where every model that performs decently gets saved together with its performance metrics and preprocessing/feature engineering details. While the model choice is relatively straightforward (constraints are no deep learning, no ensemble modelling) a lot of effort will be on the feature engineering part ( the data is highly imbalanced and with a 200+ features that will need to be selected, and engineered heavily). Also we expect much more data to come in the future, so 100% we will need to retrain the whole thing in a few months.

**It occurred to me that while saving the trained model is straightforward, I do not really know how to save the preprocessing pipelines details!**

I was wondering if you have any idea /tool /best practice to ensure reproducible feature engineering and safe storage of preprocessing steps. The current options I am thinking are:

\-  Save every time the table of the preprocessed data together with the model (feasible but probably memory / cost intensive since the archive is all on AWS)

\-  Setup a system where preprocessing is defined in a config file that gets saved in the model archive (currently seems the best option, but it is not very easy to setup without specific tools)

\- ...?

"About to get ramped up responsibilities. Any insight? Hi,

Just got word I’ll eventually be dabbling with Alteryx and data warehouse/cloud software in the nearish future. I’ll be getting one of 2 licenses in our department (My boss has the other one). I just got this job about 2 months ago, and I’m realizing the job description was a bit vague. 

I’m pretty strong with SQL already, and I’m dabbling in DAX for some personal/work projects. I don’t have much more detail on the data warehouse stuff, but from I’ve see it looks like it’s a spawn off of SQL and XML? 

What is this software based on, language wise? SQL, XML, DAX, etc?

"Are moving average samples from a population bounded by the central limit theorem? In trading a often see people use moving averages, or exponentially weighted moving averages, and bollinger bands (2 standard deviations away from the moving average) as part of their trading strategies to help indicate when something may be close to reverting to back to a mean value. This would seem to only have any effectiveness if the moving averages followed the central limit theorem, so we could more accurately know the spred of the sampling distribution. 

So do moving averages (and EWMA) follow the central limit theorem?",data science

"One dependent variable, multiple ways of grouping the data I'm having some struggles figuring out what statistical test I need to be using, I expect there's an easy answer and I'm just not stat-literate enough!

I have a load of measurements of a continuous variable, I can split the data into two groups based on some biological trait, do a t-test and find a significant difference in the means of the two groups. Happy days.

However, I can think of other (but related) ways of grouping the same data and come up with theoretical reasons as to why there may be differences in the continuous measurement between groups. I could do multiple t-tests on different ways of grouping the data, and maybe compare t values or p values to see which categorisation method offers the best explanation for the observed differences? I'm sure there must be a more elegant way though.

Two-way anova doesn't seem right because I don't think I care about interactions between independent variables. I want to know whether categorising the data by different independent variables produces a more or less significant difference in sample means... I think.

"[Spoilers] I'm still mad on how the show messed up Loras Tyrell as a character I've recently been rewatching the show while also reading (binging) the books, and I realized how badly Loras is done in the show. The actor is really good, don't get me wrong, but the writing... Loras is part of the Kingsguard, he has an actual personality beyond his sexuality, whereas in the show its like ""oh look, he's gay!"", and then... yeah. Nothing, really. They take everything from Loras that makes him a good character in the books.

Even more angry am I about the fact that they took away the friendship between Jaime and Loras. Jaime defended him against Cersei (more than once), and wanted to make him the Lord Commander while he's gone; he even compared Loras to himself (and to Cersei, once, I think).

And all of that is gone in the show, his love for Renly is downplayed to a degree where he screws some other man as soon as he gets to it while in the books he still mourns Renly (and tells Jaime about it, actually).

Loras, in the books, is one of my favorite characters. And then in the show he's just... there? And then he gets captured, and then he's dead. It's so.. disappointing and I wonder why they did it?",game of thrones

"What conclusions can you draw from a single data point? I have heard multiple times that there are none. That you can't draw any conclusions from a single data point. Google searches seem to support that.

But this seems obviously false. 

For example, let's say I'm looking at how long it took for the first life forms to evolve on Earth. Recent research has pushed back evidence for life to very early in Earth's history (~4 billion years ago). This seems to *suggest* that life evolves easily if the conditions are correct (early Earth being a very violent place).

To further illustrate this, let's assume I get evidence that life evolved 1 second after it became possible for it to on Earth. This is a single data point, but it says something very different than if it took 2 billion years for life to first evolve. To further push the limits, if my single data point says that life evolved .0000001 seconds after it became possible for it to, I personally would be perfectly confident saying ""I am &gt;95% confident life would take *less* than a billion years to evolve if we repeated this experiment"". I would happily bet 1:20 odds on such a conclusion.

On to another example, if I want to know what % of people prefer chocolate vs. vanilla ice cream, and the first person I sample likes chocolate ice cream, I already can strongly discount the option that 99.99999999% of the populace will prefer vanilla. So I'm definitely narrowing in on whatever the true ratio is, even if not by much.

So I guess my question is - how do you calculate the standard deviation of a dataset, from which you only have a single data point? Or something else meaningful? There has to be *some* way to quantify information out of a single data point.

EDIT: so far, thanks for everyone who has responded. I still don't understand the answers. Lots of people are saying that there is no information gained from a single data source, but no one has really fully *explained* or *proved* it to me yet. Maybe that involves more work than I can expect, but if you can provide a source of additional reading when you comment I would super-super appreciate it!

EDIT 2: I am trying hard to reply to everyone, but I may not be able to. I have a lot of reading to do, both from outside this thread and from sources linked to me from within this thread. It's been interesting, though I fear my inability to express my points in a purely logical way has caused some confusion.

They are linked below, and might be worth looking over if you think you may not understand where I am coming from.

"A little help analyzing visa misuse rates? **Problem:** We have observed outcomes from two different population samples, one representing a ""high fraud"" population that misuses their visa at a higher rate than another population. I'm trying to compute a single statistic that represents how much more likely it is that a random sample from the ""high fraud"" population would misuse their visa when compared with another population.

**Population 1:** This is the high fraud region. Because this region is known to be historically high fraud, suppose only 10% of the population is issued a visa as determined by expert judgment. Of the 10% of the population that receives a visa, 6% go on to misuse the visa, which constitutes fraud.

**Population 2:** In this population, the same expert judgment standard results in 70% of the population being issued a visa, of which 3% go on to misuse the visa.

What is the best way to compare the fraud rates in these two populations given that only the best 10% of the high fraud population receives a visa but goes on to misuse the visa at a rate twice as high as a population in which 70% of the population receives a visa?

A point in the right direction would really be appreciated. What we are trying to do is calculate the ""expected misuse rate"" in the entire population and specifically compare fraud rates between any two regions accounting for the fact that in some cases the vast majority of the visa applicants are denied a visa and never given an opportunity to misuse it.",data science

How are the big tech companies in this regard? I know some of the open DS positions are more analytics, which is slightly concerning given that I like the development side a more, but I might be okay with it.

-The Starks finally got Winterfell back and Jon is named King in the North (it's also imply that Sansa might not be too happy about that and LF seems more than happy to take advantage of that)

-Cersei exploded the Vatican with the HS, the Tyrell - except Olenna and her other ennemies. Tommen kills himself and Cersei seizes the Iron Throne

-Dany makes Tyrion her hand and they sail to Westeros with the Tyrell and the Martell's forces behind them


So, do you think an open ending like this would have worked ? Do you think most fans would have been satisfied and individually what would you have think of it ?

(Sorry for asking again this similar question, I'm just really thinking hard about GOT's terrible ending lately and I can't help but wondering that if the show was doomed to fail this spectaculary given who was in charge of it, was there a way to prevent the damage the last two seasons did ?)

[EDIT] : Alright I think it's clear now. Game of Thrones couldn't have ended at the end of S4 nor at the end of S6, but what about S7- No I'm joking 😂😂
This is a story that needs a complete ending tying all the storylines into something that makes sense and is faithful to this universe we fell in love with.

When I first heard The Less I Know The Better by Tame Impala it quickly became one of my favorites and I've been a fan since Lonerism. Now I skip it every time it shows up in my old playlists and I can't stand it.

"Help with Text Classification for Reference Management [D] I need to parse several technical text documents to find every instance of references. 

Using regular expressions, I easily managed to extract every mention of references, because all our documents follow naming standards. 

For example : ABC0001, AB-000-001, AB-00001, etc. 

The problem I am facing is that often, a text won't just reference another document, but will instead  say that it is being referenced by another document. 

For example, here are 2 possible sentences:

&gt; For further detail, go see AB-000-001.

or

&gt; This document is used as a reference by AB-00001.

Since these sentences don't necessarily follow a pattern, I'd like to use a simple text classification model to detect whether a sentence is referencing  to another document, or is the subject of a reference. 

I was inspired by an article on towardsdatascience for sarcasm detection, but I can't find a pre-exisiting data set for my problem. Do I have to train a model from scratch, or are there simpler ways of getting the job done ?

"[D] Input propagation through a general recurrent neural network in case of reinforcement learning Hello!

I am trying to evolve neural networks using the NEAT (Neuroevolution for Augmenting Topologies) algorithm for a reinforcement learning task. However, I'm confused as to how the input will propagate through a recurrent network evolved through this process.

NEAT does not discriminate between looping and non-looping edges (I remember reading a comment somewhere in the original code) unlike a typical backprop trained RNN which does. So when allowed to evolve recurrent networks, we must use a synchronous approach to propagate forward:

	For each timestep:
		temp = getNewOutputs(current_outputs_of_nodes, new_inputs_to_network) for each node
		setOutputs(temp) for each node

That is, the new outputs are calculated from a snapshot of the current outputs, and then the outputs are updated simultaneously for all neurons. Am I correct here? I don't see any other way to do a forward prop without discriminating between looping and non-looping edges. Here, each neuron calculates output at time = t with the inputs from other neurons being their outputs at time = t-1. In contrast, a typical RNN forward propagates in a topological sorted manner (ignoring the looping edges) and only for the looping edges the t-1 values are used.

However, for a reinforcement learning task, let's say the input vectors are v1, v2, v3 ... vn, where the number represents the time unit. Now assume that we are at time t, and the inputs to network changes to vt. The output, however, doesn't immediately get this information in one time step as the updates are synchronous. In other words, the information of input change hops only one edge in one time-step so the outputs won't reflect this immediately. Will this delayed response not make the system perform poorly? Or am I missing something?

Any help will be appreciated. TIA.

The score of any form of visual has such an impact and really makes me feel the emotions of what is happening on the screen even if what is happening may not be perfectly executed. For this reason I say season 8 is Djawadis best score, and is the one I listen to the most.

"Cointegration of two time series This is more of a conceptual question. I'm wondering whether a linear relationship exists between two time series: short-term interest rate differential of U.S. and U.K. and the GBP/USD exchange rate where observations are taken on a daily frequency since 2015.

I ran Dickey-Fuller test on both and find both series to be non-stationary, which indicates that as a framework a linear regression model may not be useful (here short-term rates are the independent variable and GBP/USD is the dependent variable). However, if the two series are non-stationary and cointegrated then the residuals from a linear regression model will be stationary and hence the linear regression model could be useful. However, when I test for cointegration using Johansen's test I find no cointegration equation between the two series (the output results are below using XLSTAT), which undermines the case for a linear regression I presume.

I'm not sure what to make of this result as it's hard to believe that differentials in short-term interest rates between U.S. and U.K. and the respective exchange rate aren't cointegrated. What am I missing here?

Results from Johansen's test at 5% significance level (the variable 'Actual' is the GBP/USD exchange rate and SHORT\_RATES is the variable capturing the differential in short-term interest rates):

Our solution allows the user to use the cameras on their VR headset as their eyes to see and interact with the real world while still wearing their headset, a feature often referred to as Passthrough. The central challenge when building such a system is the choice and implementation of algorithms under the strict compute, power, and performance constraints imposed by the target user experience and mobile platform. A key contribution of this paper is a complete description of a corresponding system that performs temporally stable passthrough rendering at 72 Hz with only 200 mW power consumption on a mobile Snapdragon 835 platform. Our algorithmic contributions for enabling this performance include the computation of a coarse 3D scene proxy on the embedded video encoding hardware, followed by a depth densification and filtering step, and finally stereoscopic texturing and spatio-temporal up-sampling. We provide a detailed discussion and evaluation of the challenges we encountered, as well as algorithm and performance trade-offs in terms of compute and resulting passthrough quality.""",data science

"[SPOILERS] How I wanted Game of Thrones to end Pt.1 I'll focus this on changing only Season 8, honestly mainly the second half of Season 8 and the Long Night battle. I liked the first two episodes. I feel they really bring back a lot of what made me fall in love with the show in the first place.  Even the battle, for the most part, was great. I would have removed some of the plot armor from some of the characters though. Especially with the blunder in the crypts of Winterfell. My biggest change to that episode, that changes the whole rest of the show, is that they lose that battle. 

Bran: He could have been so important and intriguing. The show already has shown that Bran can manipulate the past. In one of the Three Eyed Raven scenes in season 6 or 7, Bran sees the true events of the Tower of Joy.  For a moment, Bran calls out to his young father. Young Ned hears Bran and reacts, proving Bran can influence the past.  I wanted the show to dive deeper into this. It almost seems like they were going to go down this path, but something changed by the end of season 7.  Bran constantly got visions of the Mad King in the throne room, cursing ""burn them all.""  What if Bran went back to the past and corrupted the Mad King. Whispering of the cold death that marches in the north. Trying to get the Mad King to deal with the white walkers,  that way, they're already dead in the future.  But the whispers just drive him mad, the true reason for his madness. Bran failed. Now the king is insane and there's nothing he can do to stop him burn his grandfather and uncle alive. Burn them all. Bran meant the white walkers.  He meant the dead. The Mad King took that to mean everyone.  Determined, he goes deeper into the past to find some other way to stop it.  He goes back further and further, each time failing, each time making the past happen as it has.  Until he's as back as far as he can go. He's at the creation of the white walkers by that tree with the Children of the forest. They sense him. Use some old magic to force Bran into the man they have tied to the tree. The children turn then turn the man into the Night King.  It's mission set by the Children of the forest to beat back mankind.  So thats what he does for thousands of years. Until eventually,  the Night King comes across Bran for the first time. They touch. Something awakens in the Night King. It's what's left of Bran. It's calling out for one last attempt to end this. To end it all before it begins. All he needs to do is kill Bran before he travels back to be turned into the Night King. That becomes his new motivation. Now, I should mention that all this time travel influencing stuff is happen from the time Bran gets to Winterfell. You know, when he's pretty much useless sitting there in the Godswood? Well, this gives him something to do. Until the battle. His last ditch effort is on that night. Thats the night he goes back as far as he can to see the Night King get created. That's the night he becomes the Night King. Remember when Bran caused Hodor to Hodor and that daisy chained the rest of Bran's life to happen? We learned there that Bran can't change the past, he can only complete his roll to allow the past to happen.  So that's what he did here.  Once Bran travels back to the past for the final time, the Night King will have just entered the Godswood. 

The Long Night:  Like I said earlier,  some of this plot armor has to go.  In the Godswood, as the Night King is approaching Bran, an epic battle ensues with Theon, Arya, Beric, and Gendry against the white walkers. One by one, they're getting mowed down. First Beric, then Gendry. They take out 2 white walkers before they die, but its not enough. It's Arya and Theon backed up against Bran. Theon tells Arya to run before being cut down. She makes her way to the tree line and looks back in time to see the Night King plunge his sword into the warged Bran.  She escapes the Godswood and sneaks around the overrun castle, looking for survivors.  She finds the Hound, Brianne and Tormond, fighting in the courtyard. She tells them we've lost, we need to run. They fight there way to the crypt. Arya knows a secret way out of the castle through there. That's where they find Sansa, Tyrion and Davos. Gilly and Messandei died in the crypt. The rest make their way out of the city and into the dark winter woods. Dany and Drogon helped Jon escape the Wight Dragon and flew away. That's all that gets away. Everyone else dies.  The Night King wins. Now, with that last bit of Bran Stark resolved, the Night King continues its original intended goal, beat back humanity. That night, the army of the dead begins its march south.  

Cercei: In my version, she would get what she deserves.  Winter would come for Kings Landing.  But the Night King as a different tactic. He surrounds the city with a mile of undead and waits.  He waits and waits and waits.  After all, he brings the storm. And a city of a million people can only last so long without provisions. People start dying by the thousands.  Until the only ones left are the rich and their guard. At least what's left after the uprisings. Months go by, and Cercei is about ready to have her child. Her water breaks. There's only one wet nurse  left to help her from the throne room to the nursery.  On her way down, her foot slips on an icy step. The nurse runs for a maester. At the bottom of the staircase, bleeding, Cercei lies screaming, for Jaimie, for her baby.  The maester and the wet nurse manage to get Cercei to the nursery, she's still screaming in pain, bleeding profusely. She looks down at her wriggling stomach in horror. She can only scream and claw at the ground as she watches her belly torn open from the inside. And what emerges, ironically looks like what Cercei imagined Tyrion looked like when he killed their mother. Except this creature was partially rotted, and glowing a blue eye.  That's how I would have liked Cercei to meet her end. 

So TLDR:
Bran made the Mad King mad.
Bran's the Night King on accident. 
Night King wins at Winterfell and kills almost everyone except like 10 people. 
Cercei gets eaten by her undead unborn monster baby.

The score is Westeros:0, Night King:2

For daenerys defeats, some of them made sense (highgarden for example, i mean pretending that the Lannisters basically walked into the castle with no resistance was wrong, but if Olenna lost support in her lands, who attacked her instead, yeah she could lose. it was also logical that they attacked highgarden)

I do fully agree that the defeat on sea, so Yara's and the unsullied's fleets, were stupid

I am glad that littlefinger's plans even exist in s7, there is basically no plotting or scheming in s8, which really contributes to it feeling rushed. (Yeah there was Varys plan to put Jon on the throne, but that ended the same episode it started)

Basically (most of) the main plot points are good in s7, but as you say, very poorly executed, while in s8 the whole plot had 0 logic:

for example, dany becoming mad, could be good but there was practically no build-up to it. at least Euron was an established villain, of whom we already knew he had a fleet, when he attacked yara and the unsullied, it didn't just come out of literally nowhere.

I binged the show in less than a month, which was super fun. Yeah the destination wasn’t very good, but I LOVED the journey. From a filmmaking standpoint, it’s an incredible show, with some of the best production value I’ve seen on TV. And the writing is amazing in seasons 1-6. I love how the show was always one step ahead of me. My favorite scene in the show might be scene where The Mountain duels Oberyn Martell, because it’s an example of how great the writing is condensed into one scene. Any other show or movie would have Oberyn get his revenge on the people who raped his sister, then killed her along with her children. But nope, this is Game of Thrones. The way the show throws all the narrative cliches out the window and brilliantly subverts the viewers expectations made me fall in love with the show. It’s shock value, but not just for the sake of shock value. Almost everything had a reason and justification for happening. Obviously, season 8 lacks this, which is why I don’t like it, but it doesn’t take away everything great the show has done in my opinion. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed with the ending, I really am. It wasn’t a matter of choices the characters made, but how those choices were developed. Every choice made in the end could’ve been pulled off, even Dany’s heel turn, but it was just so damn rushed.

And it seemed like something that's an ability from birth since I don't recall anyone saying how this skill comes about otherwise. But then Thoros of Myr comes along and he's a Red Priest just like her, only using his powers for good as far as we know (bringing Beric back from the dead over and over) while we've never seen Melisandre bring anyone to life, only kill and plot to kill.

I feel like I'm missing a lot here. From what I gathered, Thoros basically discovered the Lord of Light by accident, right?

I just rewatched “The long night” episode and I can’t believe the lack of praise that episode got. Even if I’m wrong I believe that had to be the greatest battle in game of thrones history. The Dragons, the Wights, the entire North with the Dothraki and unsullied⚔️. 

Hell, if anyone paid attention I’m pretty sure they actually BEAT the army of the dead after the first round, it only became hopeless after the knight king resurrected everyone that just got killed 💀.  It was a proper battle of the living versus the dead and after the victory I personally would’ve rode to kings landing and burned that entire sh*t hole down just to get to Cersi. Call me petty but her own goddamn brother fought for the north and was willing to die for the living but not her selfish ass. 

Then there’s the arguments i hear the most. “Why didn’t Jon killed the knight king”? The mf wasn’t there for Jon, you really think the knight king was gonna drop everything he was doing to have a 1v1 against some guy he’s almost killed twice. Jon is my favorite character but cmon. “Why the hell would the women and children go hide in a crypt if they know the knight king can bring back the dead”? Okay, where would you have put them? Everyone knew there was a good chance the dead would storm into winter fell. Arya was literally in the castle hiding from wights that broke in god knows when.

Only dumb part to me is when the Dorthraki rode into the Dead Army like maniacs and got slaughtered but hey, it looked cool for a minute lol. 

I’m sad the last half of season 8 couldn’t live up to the half season finales greatness. The amount of plot holes oh my lord. I’m sure everyone was scratching their head when Danaerys’ army just magically respawned. Other than that, it’s just one mans opinion.",game of thrones

This model is available to try at [MakeMeAZombie.com](https://makemeazombie.com)  


This model was developed independently from the [Toonify](https://toonify.justinpinkney.com/) model, but coincidentally landed on the same same technology stack:  I transfer-learned a StyleGAN2 zombie generator, then - inspired by   
 [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ijkkbb/p_crossmodel_interpolations_between_5_styleganv2/) \- I performed surgery to create a hybrid StyleGAN2 model whose earlier layers are from the original human generator and whose later layers are from the zombie generator.  Finally, having read  [StyleGAN2 Distillation for Feed-Forward Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03581), I dumped 50000 pairs of images - the first from the human StyleGAN2 generator, and the second with the same latent space representation, but passed through the zombie generator.  I then used Pix2PixHD to learn a mapping from the pairs.

Two minor differences in our approaches: 1) I augmented my input data by ""[crappifying](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/crappify.py)"" it : purposefully introducing resizing and compression artifacts, and 2) I suspect we have different hybrid models, since mine emphasizes the shape and orientation of the original image, but the texture of the zombie image, and toonification is the opposite.  


The zombie dataset is a set of about 300 images of zombie Halloween masks and people in Zombie makeup.  It comes mostly from Pinterest and Google, and was hand filtered to throw out non-zombies.  


It's interesting to note some stumbling blocks.  Namely, I tried this last year on the same dataset with CycleGAN, and it was only alright.  We've definitely come a long way in the last year.  Also, I initially tried to learn a generator half of whose images were human and half were zombies.  I then sorted hundreds of examples into the two categories, and learned a separating hyperplane with an SVM to determine a ""zombie"" direction in latent space.  I then targeted a particular ""zombiness"" starting from a human face.  I then used this as the basis for my Pix2Pix data.  This had issues, the primary two being that 1) while this worked well on generated humans, it only produced mediocre results on real images, and 2) there was some entanglement between zombiness and race, and I didn't want to get into the business of creating a race changer.  


Finally, one interesting thing for me about this project was that I was able to train the model at a 1024x1024 size on my home 2080Ti in about a day.  Both the CycleGAN2 and Pix2PixHD repos suggest there is some difficulty doing this, but fiddling with batch size and learning rate and turning on AMP, I was able to do it without much difficulty.

"YouTube Bot for Research Project \[Crossposted from r/codinghelp\]

Hey guys,

My  friend and I are working on an academic research project to analyze  YouTube's video recommendation system and its overarching effects of  sending viewers deep down into rabbit holes based on what might have  been an initial, innocent click.

We  wanted to create a bot that could automatically watch YT videos by  beginning with a manually input, and subsequently following the  recommend videos in an attempt to replicate and observe the path one can  go down when relying on this system.

However,  it seems that bots in any form are against YT's Terms of Service,  understandably so. Our research has not shown much helpful info that  could be used to make such a bot.

I  was wondering if anyone might be familiar with any way to proceed with  this. In no way do we intend to use the bot to abuse YouTube - if  created, the bot would watch the whole length of the video and would not  watch a single video more than once. We simply want to use the bot as a  means of automating what would be a tedious process, so we can  empirically demonstrate the rabbit holes YT's users can spiral down.

"It seems impossible to actually get anywhere on my own. Took online courses but anything outside the scope of them leaves me completely lost. I took 2 courses on data visualization one being 

'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp'

And another one being

""Data Visualization for Python"" by IBM.


I also watched a bunch of YouTube videos and all that.


And every damn time I have an idea of what I want to analyze/visualize, I get completely lost because it's outside of how things were structured in those courses. Because the courses always work with very simple and straightforward data. The courses taught me how to do ""step 1"", ""step 2"" etc. but they didn't actually teach me what ""step 1"" and ""step 2"" should be to begin with. When and how to use what.
_____________

**Idea one**: ""Lets take Worldbank data for a couple key indicators over 50 years for a couple different countries and compare them"".

Where I failed: In 2 weeks of working on it, I wasn't able to figure out how to structure the data so that I could visualize it. I separated each country into a dataframe but then realized that in seaborn you input a ""data"" variable which can only be one dataframe and so I realized my approach was probably wrong, but I couldn't figure out what the correct one is. 



**Idea two** (which I thought was simpler): ""Let's take Google Trends data comparing search frequency of 2 different terms within a country""

Where I failed: [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam#Regions) is the structure that I wanted to emulate, but unlike the first idea, I kind of don't even know where to start with this. I just created a list for every region ( region1 = province 1, province 2, etc.)  and then grouped then for every macro-region (macro_region1 = region 1, region 2 etc.) and then the country (country = macro_region1,... etc....) And passed 'country' into a data frame and obviously that didn't work, which I suspected would be the case from the beginning but I didn't really have any other idea.

It makes zero sense to me that he would bet on  the Lannisters going out of power anytime soon at that point, so is his  plan to sieze the North for himself and then launch a campaign towards  the crown? If that's the case why would Sansa back them after what they  have done and what Ramsay is, he would have to break her like Theon  pretty much but even then he would need every single lord on board to  even have a slight chance against the Lannisters.

I  can't really find a way that it makes much sense considering how, let's  say, pragmatic Roose Bolton has been made out to be earlier on. He even  flat out says that he doesn't trust Littlefinger but even if he did it  would be a declariation of war on the crown pretty much unless he hoped  to keep Sansa locked up in secret but then why have an official wedding  at that point and not just ""save her"", locked away, for later?",game of thrones

It looks like there are a [lot](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/extra_capsnets.ipynb) of [different](https://github.com/bourdakos1/capsule-networks) [implementations](https://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks/blob/master/capsLayer.py) of Capsule Networks in TensorFlow. However, most of these seem to be versions of [https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow).

My issue with naturomic's (Huadong Liao) implementation is that it's hard-coded specifically for MNIST.

For example, there are assert statements like assert caps1.get\_shape() == \[cfg.batch\_size, 1152, 8, 1\]  
 that only make sense if you're using a dataset with the same dimensions as MNIST.

Are there any implementations of Capsule Networks for TensorFlow that are more general?

If not, I'll try to go about making my own, probably by working from [naturomic's implementation](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow) and replacing the MNIST constants with variables and editable properties.

"[SPOILERS] top 5 most interesting and uninteresting characters in the book series IMO 
Top 5 most interesting 

1. Jaime Lannister - Jaime is more complex as the books go one. He is conflicted by duty and love for his family, and duty to the people as a knight. Jaime leads us to question what is “right” and ask ourselves what would we do on his shoes. His fall from grace and efforts to be an honorable man make his character arc one of the best  in the series.

2. Theon Greyjoy. Theon is another who challenges the ideas of loyalty. He has the most gruesome and redeeming character arcs in the series. 

3. Stannis Baratheon: stannis makes the audience ask themselves what makes a good leader? Is it roberts strength, reply’s flair and charisma or an undying sense of duty. Stannis is tortured by his past and is a character we all can relate to.

Tyrion: this one is pretty obvious. The witty quips keep the audience entertained while turning the typical hero trope on its head.

Sandor Clegane: the hound makes us ask ourselves what is truly good? He id a tortured character who despises the knightly ideals we grew up with. Best antihero in the series.

Top 5 most uninteresting:

1. Robb stark: while a fan favorite Robb was too much the knight in shining armor trope with little interesting dialogue.

2. Bran stark: not his fault but it’s from the perspective of an 8 year old. Not terribly interesting.

3. Cersei Lannister: her whiny and bratty nature at times make her chapter unreadable. I found her to be a bit one noted.

4. Viserys Targaryen: this is another who is one noted. We get it you want your crown…

5. Victarion Greyjoy: while conceptually cool he pales in comparison to his brother euron. He is an ill tempered and dumb brute who’s chapters I did not care for.",game of thrones

"[Spoilers] Why Ser Denys Mallister Is the Most Influential Game of Thrones Character Ser Denys Mallister is truly the most influential character in Game of Thrones. In 5:2, he is present at the Night's Watch when the election for the 998th Lord Commander takes place.

Ser Alliser Thorne was supposed to win in a landslide. When an unknown character nominates this gentlemen from the Shadow Tower who just magically showed up. Mallister, an old veteran of the Night's Watch seemed to appeal to the conservative members of the Night's Watch who may have been put off by Ser Alliser's harsh treatment of new recruits, yet would have never voted for Jon Snow. After all, ""He helped keep the wildlings away"".

Perhaps Alliser thought he would dominate a one-on-one election with Mallister, which would have probably been correct just on name recognition. When Jon Snow is nominated by Samwell Tarly, that changes everything, as many see Jon's short but proven time with the Night's Watch in a very high light. Now instead of running unopposed, Alliser has a real fight on his hands.

When we look at Maester Aemon counting the votes, it should be noted in the show only a simple majority is needed to win. We see Jon Snow with 28 votes, Ser Alliser with 28 votes, and that plucky man from the Shadow Tower with 8 votes.

Denys Mallister's involvement as a sort of third party candidate pulled votes away from Ser Alliser. It contributed to the tie, and led to Maester Aemon casting the tiebreaking vote for Jon Snow. If Mallister had not run, Ser Alliser would have won comfortably with those 8 Mallister votes going his way.

With Ser Alliser in charge, the entire show is changed. Jon Snow could end up going with Stannis and becoming Jon Stark. The wildlings aren't led south as Ser Alliser would have never allowed it. Daenarys never flies north (maybe never even meeting Jon). The Night King wouldn't have had Viserion.

Think of Ser Denys Mallister as the Gary Johnson of Game of Thrones. He changed the entirety of the show.

"[SPOILERS] Did you like Jaime's conclusion? I'm just curious because I see a lot of people hating on it because it undermines what a great guy Jaime was but I think it's 1 of the few things (maybe the only thing) season 8 does right. 

I don't like his thicc ass plot armor (or that he survived the long night) but I don't think Jaime was this great guy everyone sees. This is the same man who raped his sister next to her son's corpse and threatened to catapult Edmure's baby at a stone wall. 

Yes he saved half a million people at king's landing but why? Was it just for them? Not for his father? Himself? The fact he constantly says he'll do anything to see Cersei again? 

Had Tywin ordered the death of everyone at king's landing would he have stopped him? Would he oppose his own family to save civilians? He didn't do anything when the Targaryen children were being murdered. Because it didn't harm him or his family in any way. Cersei blows up the Sept and he still stays by her side. 

A bad character can do good things. Example both Stannis and Baelish have done good things but they're far from being good people. The books might head in a different direction but as far as the show goes I don't think this out of character for Jaime to go back. They showed us time and time again he is a selfish person. Giving Brienne armor to repay a debt is a nice thing but again Baelish saving Sansa was a nice thing. Him being nice to your favorite character (Tyrion and Brienne) doesn't make him a nice person. 1 is family the other is a friend. But what about civilians? He's never showed cared for them. 

But feel free to disagree and if there are any spelling errors my bad.

Edit - Also him killing Cersei would've done absolutely nothing as Dany mawn lowers the city anyways and only does a drive by at the red keep. So him killing her would've essentially just been for the sake of him killing her and not the saving of anybody.

But I am still not clear :( 

I have a production unit (producing Chips for example). Lately we are  facing the problem in 1 key quality parameter. 
**Data**

Independent (Aim) - This is specific Target for any chip.

Dependent (Meas) - This is actual measured value for the chip.

**Method of Measurement**

For any 1 chip (id-AB01) Aim = 600, for this product we take ~40000 measurements. 

Each measurement is assigned  **1** if it = 600 (+/- 5) else **0**

if 35000 measurements were found true then
Meas = (35000/40000)*100 = 87.5

"Recommend any software to enter data of valid combinations of a highly customization product? I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a way to help visualize my data problem. I have a product that can be customized to a high degree. however certain choices aren't compatible with other choices. So I wanted to first of all enter the data in some sort of interface and then from that generate a set of rules from it. 

Let's say the product is a kettle that can come in 10 colours. It also has 5 different options for handles, but maybe one handle doesn't come in one of the listed colours so that's an illegal combination.  The kettle also has different power button styles. But some of those buttons don't fit certain handles. It also has different power chords, but they're not all compatible with certain handles etc etc. You get the idea.

I started to use free online mind-mapping software to draw connections between all the various bits but can't do much with that visual. Is there any software that you can recommend for my purpose? One that will allow me to generate rules that I could use in some custom software to allow only valid variants of the kettle? A nice GUI like mind mapping software would be great.

"Optimizing a forecast I'm working through building a model for a call arrival forecast, I would want to calculate how accurate a given model is to the actuals arrival pattern given that I could predict the #of calls for a total day with 100% accuracy. To do this, I could calculate the area between the curves (actuals vs model) and see which is the smallest on average for all parameter options for the model.Now I should be able to calculate an equation which passes through the all the points by solving a system of equations of the form 
y= a(x)^n + b(x)^(n-1)+ ...+ and then performing numerical integration and subtracting the results to obtain the area. Is there a better way go about this? Is there a good package in R which might make these calculations a bit easier to perform?



Edit: I just realized this won't work. If my model can predict the number of calls with 100% accuracy, then the area under each curve is the same, i.e. the total call volume, and thus the difference is always 0.

"[D][P] Feedforward Noise Cancelling Project. Looking for some advice before i dive into details.   

Hi I am beginner with ML and finished one minor project yet using a simple neural network.

Now I am heading towards a new project which is more complex and searching for good approach.

Since I have not much experience, I want to introduce you the project and hoping for some ideas. 

(Which approach makes sense NN, RNN, RL or alternative approaches?)

The main goal of the project is to find parameters (amplitude (A\_i)  and phase  (P\_i) at fixed frequencies (i) (i=50Hz, 100Hz… ) for a sinusoid ) for a signal generator. The generated signal is then added to the “main” signal in order to cancel out some noise (which consist of these n x 50Hz frequencies). Basically, it is a noise channeling problem and can be solved by a feedforward algorithm.

The input is a measurement (duration 2-8 seconds) of the main signal. If a Fourier transformation (FFT) is performed the amplitudes of the 50Hz harmonics (50Hz,100Hz,150Hz…) are clearly observable (in the FFT). With the correct A\_i and P\_i the amplitude of the frequency i can be suppressed (so the frequency is compensated by the additional introduced signal created by our signal generator). The goal is now to find these perfect A\_i and P\_i for each frequency i.

The first measurements have shown that for each FFT\_amplitude(frequency i), a unique minimum can be found and a gradient towards this minimum has been observed ( simplified: FFT\_amplitude= (A\_i)\^2+(P\_i)\^2) .

The loop for the optimization would look like:

1. Measurement of the main signal --&gt; FFT

2. Input (n x 1 array) : \[FFTamptitude\_1,…., FFTamptitude\_n\]

3. Optimization algorithm (NN, RNN, RL ) ?

4. Output (n x 2 array): \[\[A\_1,P\_1\],\[A\_2,P\_2\],…. ,\[A\_n,P\_n\]\]

5. Signal processing

6. Measurement of the main signal with the added signal

&amp;#x200B;

The Loss function could look like:

Loss = sum ( FFTamptitude\_i ), (trying to minimize the loss function)

&amp;#x200B;

Since FFT\_amplitude= (A\_i)\^2+(P\_i)\^2, a training simulation can be created in order to “pre”-train the algorithm. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I made the situation clear.

One problem to me:

The output is an array of parameters, but the loss function has to be calculated with the measurement of point 6 (see above). I would have to treat the output as a layer in order to get the backpropagation working right? (Please add some advice)

Furthermore, the algorithm has always to wait for the Measurement. Is that an Issue? I want to use Keras.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? Are NN, RNN, RL capable to solve this task?

Which would be the best approach? What problems do you see? 

Do you know any comparable project or paper? (Please share it)",data science

"Which method to use? Hi guys, I know next to nothing about statistics so I am just going to pose my question in layman’s terms.

My data looks like this:

Subject a | scores 11 on trait X | answered a, d, f, g

Subject b | scores 89 on trait X | answered b, c,

Subject c | scores 52 on trait X | answered a, c, f

I am hoping to discover if a low or high score on trait X ‘predicts’ / correlates with the answers (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) given by the subjects, hence, their preferences.

My population consists of 27 subjects as does my sample size. I think this implies a non-parametric method but I’m not sure.

The score for the trait X is always between 1 and 100.

Also, the question has 7 distinct possible answers and does not include a don’t know / other option.

So, if you would be able to point me to the right method to use that would be great.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

"Obfuscate Exact Value Using Randomized Distribution Cloud The following may be aid in giving the AI's a bit more fluidity and less preciseness allowing for continual calibration.

If you ever have to give your age, a price you bought something for, how much you make an hour or a year, etc. you may want to give people a range or something less than precise. Many people might pick a number range where the actual number is almost in the middle of the range. That is not very good for security so you can enhance it a bit.

If your age is 45 and you would like to fuzz the number a bit you can build two ranges and put them together afterwards.

You choose a half range number that gets fuzzed first. We will use the number 10. The first random generation of 1-10 range as we chose ten as our first half range number to fuzz. We will choose 7. Our below range is now 45-7=38. Now we fuzz the top end. Our second range number will be 4. We now have 45+4=49. Our complete range then is a compilation of the two range numbers we have fuzzed.

Our range then is 38 to 49. That is a range of 11. If you wish to give the answer in a range form you can give them the range of 38 to 49 now. If the other person assumes the age is in the middle their assumed value with be half of 11 plus 38 with a value of 43.5 and a round up of 44 or round down of 43.

To give an exact value, we now randomize a number that we will subtract or add from one of the ends. You can choose randomly which end you will work with each time. This time we will add to the lower end. Our random number between 11 is 3. We now have 38+3=41.

The three optional assumptions or direct answers for the example are 41, 43, and 44 for the actual value being fuzzed of 45.

This system could be enhanced by adding extra rules that give you a way to determine if you want to add or subtract based on the randomized value that is chosen to fuzz each of the range extremes.

"For linear regression, why should we assume the predictor and response variables are normally distributed? I get that for simple linear regression, say y=b0+b1*x + error,

the errors should be normally distributed, have no autocorrelation, constant variance. I also understand that there should be no collinearity, and that the relationship between x and y should be linear.

Those are the standard assumptions in an intro to regressions.

However, as I'm learning about power transforms such as the Box Cox transformation, it's said that the Box Cox attempts to transform either the predictor x or response y to normally distributed if they are skewed in the first place. 

But other sources say it's not important for x and y to be normally distributed. 

So I'm thinking, if both x and y are uniformly distributed, and then there is a roughly linear relationship between them, wouldn't linear regression also work? You can still have the error be normally distributed. 

Can you comment or advise on the normality assumption? I feel the point of the Box Cox or other power transforms is to deal with non-constant variances of the error terms, and that's a more important goal and making the response normally distributed...",data science

• yes, he uses Sansa for his own gains in terrible ways, but it also advances her position of power. Def not father of the year 

• Sansa has Tully features. Obviously that’s an important detail since that’s how they figured out about Cersei kids weren’t Baratheons 

• they call her little bird.. LF sigil is a mockingbird

• Catelyn could have been jealous that ned had jon, so she got even. Part of cat liked him from when she was young, so if she was going to cheat after learning about jon, it seems like he would be the one. 

•Jon and Sansa are three years apart, and since Ned comes home after jon is born and  when the war was over, she had to get pregnant within year and half with Sansa. 

• in the books, she is the only one who doesn’t warg into her wolf, which died early but it’s seems too convenient 

•even early on, she wants power and to be a lady unlike the starks personality. After his lessons she is wise and intelligent like LF 

• LF loved Catelyn and is open about that throughout to Sansa. 

•he smuggles her out of kings landing 

•she pretends to be his bastard daughter when she leaves king landing… the irony 

•LF tries to knock out Arya, jon, Ned, and rob, but never her? Odd. Seems like his master plan was to give her what she wanted. 

•he says maybe in a different world you would be my child, what if that just meant he could claim her

• he kills her aunt suspiciously early, which wasn’t in his plan yet, but she threatened Sansa and the last thing he says is I loved your sister 

•he teaches Sansa all these lessons, but why? Her also tries to marry her off , why would he do that if he wanted to eventually marry her 

•he sends the knights of the vale to help her during battle of the bastards to get them to support her 


• when LF met with cat to try to negotiate trading Jamie for Sansa and Arya after ned died, he first tries to says I love you and destiny has given them another chance, then says don’t you want to see both your daughters again, but he knew only Sansa was there not Arya. He arguably even found out Arya was at harrenhal (maybe) and didn’t do anything. 

•going off previous point: it’s possible at that point, he wanted Sansa to get back home (ending the plan for her to marry Joffrey, which she was at this point still, and he meets with Margaery to pose the idea about her marrying Joffrey that day too the day before blackwater, so if the lannisters won, the starks would still March on capital against lannisters and take out tyrells at the same time or if Baratheons won, the tyrell idea would be discarded. LF knew if stannis won, he would eventually go to war with starks for being independent who were already an alliance with tyrells since they would be backing renley still, making the tyrells + renley side of Baratheon allies to starks in that case. That war would end with the north winning, and both Baratheon dying (or stannis would have already taken out renley for wanting his throne first, in which case would still result in tyrells being against stannis.) either way, north would win and LF, who was purposely on everyone’s good side would be the last on the council besides maester and Varys. To cool tensions, cat might marry LF as king and Sansa the heir to throne or the hier to the free north if rob died. Because he obvi didn’t take losing the north as a big problem or knew it was unavoidable since he supported the north and Sansa trumping jon. ( or if it came out Sansa was LF kid and rob died the north would have no stark to support cuz they might have beef with cat and she wouldnt have a true stark or produce any)

"[P] Magic Cards classifier in streaming Hi guys, first post here and also first serious project with ML :)

My master degree's thesis consists in a tool that detects and classifies *Magic: the Gathering* cards during a tabletop streaming (no online games). MtG official tournaments have some streaming procedures to follow, like a top-view camera, card positioning on the table, a certain lighting etc that can help the machine a lot by avoiding harsh conditions.

**Main Issue:** There are around **20.000** different cards, and some of them have more than 1 image representing em (alternative artworks or frames). Is classification with that number of classes even doable in a reasonable training time?

**How to react:** I could accept training on a smaller subset (like maybe the newest cards), but I would like to create something useful, and not just a demonstrative project. So for now I'm adopting a predictive pipeline to reduce the problem complexity and dispatch the classification to one of many networks trained on a specific different subsets of cards. This should be the standard for face recognition, so maybe it's the right answer. With that, every network should work ""only"" on \~1000 classes (with **very few datapoints per class**, sadly), and I don't know if it's the right path to follow.

Do you think there's a better approach to this kind of problem?

P.S. Macro-features are recognized with a \~99% accuracy, so they're not a problem at all.

The factor has 8 levels and 2 of the levels I have set to have the same mean and SD in the simulation. One of the responses for the levels is very different in order to ensure that the anova is always significant. 

In the simulation, I run the ANOVA followed by the Tukey test and extract the p value for the comparison. 

I ran the simulation 500 times and then look at the histogram for this p value. For whatever reason it is completely off from uniform. It is highly skewed—looks exponential with most of the histogram at 0.9-1. 

None of the p values are less than 0.05. 

In my math stats classes I learned that under H0 with equal means that p values should follow a Uniform distribution.

The show mainly takes place on the continent of Westeros which is ruled by the Seven Kingdoms. Each of the 7 Kingdoms used to be independent but they were forged into one nation by House Targaryen (house means noble family). The southernmost region of Dorne was never conquered but married into House Targaryen over a hundred years later so keep their royal stylings (The Prince of Dorne) and some of their own laws (firstborn children inherit instead of firstborn sons).  

Westeros mostly follows The Faith of the Seven - a belief in one god with 7 aspects. This was brought from an eastern tribe The Andals who migrated to Westeros. The North worships the Old Gods (trees) since they were never conquered by the Andals and the Old Gods are the religion of the First Men. The Iron Islands worship the Drowned God who is at war with the Storm God. East of Westeros R'Hllor is the dominant religion - the belief in a red god of fire to oppose darkness and night.

"[NO SPOILERS] What about a Souls-like game about the Night's Watch, when it was still fairly new? Or even earlier? First off, I'm leaving out Elden Ring from this post because while GRRM is involved, the setting is very different. Obviously this is not necessarily a new idea, but I wanted a good discussion about it and get some of my ideas into the world. Essentially the idea of a story based on a random person sent to the night's watch and having to go out into the frozen north alone to fight skeletons, dire wolves, and bandits sounds like a great setting for a Fromsoft game. Basically Ashes of Ariandel but a full game and a different world of lore and implications. A simple criminal getting caught and forced to wade through horrors and defeat God-like beings with only survival as motivation thematically fits the DS games. 

Im not sure about the proper ""period"" it would take place in, but maybe early in the nights watch creation, or even beforehand. My knowledge of lore isnt the best, but it would need to be at a time when the white walkers and other fantastical creatures and beasts weren't as rare as they are in ASOIAF. 

Combat would be self explanatory from Dark Souls, as well as some major bosses (Giants, white walkers, dragons). Stuff like special weapons you need to kill certain bosses isnt rare (looking at you storm ruler) but then again you could just make all the weapons obsidian or Valyrian steel.

"Help understanding a few layers in Tiny Yolo V4 Hi Reddit, I am working on implementing ML models in embedded hardware. One of the models we are working to implement is Tiny Yolo V4, the tflite version. I know how to mainly calculate the majority of the network, but some layers I do not know. I am sure they are easy once you understand them. Could someone help me understand what the following layers do, it would be a huge help.  

1) Pad - Okay, I know this is an easy one. Really just wanting to know how it pads given the paddings in Netron shows: \[ \[0, 0\], \[1, 0\], \[1, 0\], \[0, 0\] \]

2) Split - Pretty uncertain here, it gives axis = -1 ? The input dimension is 1, 32, 32, 128, output dimension is 1, 32, 32, 64. 

3) Strided Slice

4) Resize Nearest Neighbor

"Comment A Song of Ice and Fire (ASoIaF) is a series of 7 books (Only 5 are out so far) which is what the show is based on. So reading this series, you can read the original story and how much they differ from the show for better or for worse.
  
Fire and Blood is a single book set ~300 years before ASoIaF. This book mainly talks about House Targaryen and dragons of the time. This is apparently Volume One and there's plans for a Volume 2. But anyway, HBO is making a new show called ""House of the Dragon"" which will be set around this time period.
  
There is another book called A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms which consists of three short stories set ~90 years before ASoIaF. This book simply tells the adventures of a knight, Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire, Egg.
  
So, you can start reading either in release order which is ASoIaF -> AKotSK -> FaB or in chronological order which is the reverse of the above order.
  
  
Just a heads up, if you're reading ASoIaF, it's been more than 10 years since Book 5 has been released, and there's still no news on Book 6 or 7, so take your time while reading them XD.",game of thrones

Im curious to hear your thoughts - if I already have a B.A. in an unrelated field (Journalism), will an Associates in CS help get my foot in the door?

I’m actually trying to branch into a Product Manager role in the tech industry. I’ve been a PM outside of the tech industry for about 1.5 years, and I have about 2 years of Digital Marketing &amp; Sales experience behind that. But what I’m finding is that, without hard tech skills, I’m not fitting into the role that most Tech companies are looking for in PM’s.

Therefore, I’m considering a 2-year degree (and maybe a boot camp? Open to opinions there as well). I know many people are self-taught, but I really think I’d do better in a structured environment.

- Is a 2-year degree in CS even worth it? In your opinion, will you learn enough useful info/skills/ways of thinking to succeed?

- I know many companies require a 4-year degree, but not necessarily in CS. Do you think a B.A. plus the associates will check this box?

- I’m aware that with CS, you get out what you put in, and no degree will be a substitute for continued effort &amp; learning.

"[Spoilers] Just finished season 7, here are my thoughts I won't be reading comments until next week when I finish the series in fear of spoilers but I still encourage you to say something. 

This is probably the longest post yet, hopefully season 8 will surpass it

Season 7
I like Jamie, he deserves to die but I like him at least for now. I wish he would betray Cersi and join the starks or the Targaryens but I doubt it'll happen. He'll die next to Cersi although I wouldn't be surprised if they won. People were outraged at the ending so maybe it's because they won

The Lannister soldiers Arya meets seem really cool.  But she just said she'll kill the queen so we'll see how that goes. Is Ed Sheeran the first celeb cameo?

Jon and Daenerys teaming up? Hell yeah. I don't know why people always have to bow/bend the knee to one or another and why they can't just be equal allies but Jon being under Daenerys should work out well. I hope the two of them can kill Cersi

That crossbow thing that broke the dragon skull is worrisome. I do not like it at all, I hope varys gets down whispers about it do that they're prepared

I love grey worm and I really hope he doesn't die but I already know it'll happen, every character I cherish are gonna die 

It looks like Aray is headed to winterfell, I don't think jon will be there by the time she gets there but Sansa might. When will the stark kids reunite? Will bran see any of his siblings again?

Littlefingers obsession with Sansa is gross and strange, I hope he never gets her but again this show loves doing the opposite of what I hope for

I thought Arya couldn't die because she's a little girl but I remember babies have died on screen and so did olly so she's isn't free from the chopping block

Theon and Yara might die in the water. If they do it'll be the beginning of the end for Daenerys and her army/plan

Now I feel like Cersi will win. Yara is going to due here along with theon and the dornish women will be killed by Cersi

Theon really disappointed me, more than he did Yara. 

Oberyns wife is ignorant and I hate it. She has so much pride and ignorance mixed with her pride makes it even worse. Cersi is crazy and heartless and now that she's her prisoner I imagine she'll be tortured, not like theon was. I imagine it'll be mostly psychological rather than physical

Jamie is cheeked up just as much if not more than Cersi

I know a lot of people will die in this show so here are my predictions. Arya, Cersi, oberyns wife, Tyrion, and Yara will die in ways that I don't know. Theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. Jorah will either disappear or die for Daenerys. Little finger will die because Jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. Jamie will die for Cersi or with her. Tormund will either die for Jon or against the night king. Grey worm will probably die when attacking the rock. Cersi might not die, I wouldn't be surprised if she survived the entire time and ended up winning.

What happened to ghost? We haven't seen him since Jon was revived so is he still alive?
Sam cured jorah, maybe he'll become the best maester

The tyrells have fallen, Dorne are out of reach. Daenerys came in with overwhelming force, they could've/would've crushed the Lannisters but they're being picked apart. Their navy has been destroyed, their dragons are no longer full proof, their support is crippled, and their enemies aren't being hit nearly as hard as they're. 

Bran gave Aray his dagger, I think she did it because she'll need it in the future, perhaps against a white walker 

The dothraki charging into battle like that was amazing, their scream is awesome

I like bron but I like Daenerys and her dragons more, if he dies I'll be sadden but not as much as if the reverse happened

Will Jon and Daenerys marry? She said she needed to marry someone and he's king of the north plus a cool guy so I don't imagine there's a better option plus he gets along with drogon

Cersi needs to be assassinated before she gets all of her soilders killed 

I wish jorah would've told Jon who cured him, it wouldn't matter much but Jon would be proud of sam

Jon might lose the support of the people and they'll suffer for it

Cersi is pregnant, the Witch said that she'll only have 3 children and GOT are really good at consistency so she'll either die or miscarry

A dragon in the undead army? Holy shit. I wonder if the other dragons will kill it, a huge arrow, or if it falls with the night king

Jon has another fake out death, not mad about it but I do wish he had more time with his uncle. Maybe bran can tell him a thing or two about what happened to him. 

Will Tyrion betray the queen? 

Will Sansa betray jon or Aray? 

Aray has become hella creepy.

Is Cersi being genuine or was she twisting an arm and trying to get her way?

I hope Tyrion doesn't die here trying to convince her different.

Little finger is manipulating and feeding into sansas worst thoughts. Arya needs to kill him before it gets out of hand

I actually wasn't expecting baelish to die and be revealed as the traitor

I also wasn't expecting Cersi to be a cunt and betray the north

Cersi is going to kill Jamie or get him killed, as I write this Gregor just stepped in front of Jamie so we'll see what happens, Jamie didn't get killed and now I hope he rides north and joins Jon

Kit Harington has some nice butt cheeks

What Jon and Daenerys just did was incest right? I think the targaryens have been doing it for a long time. This is a mind fuck that I'm not sure I like. I think the maester at castle black said something about ageon which is apparently Jon's real name so did he know the truth about Jon?

I would be content if the rest of this show was just fighting the dead army

The dead army arrives and the Lannisters aren't there, no one but the men in black and the free folk are. So many people are going to die, I knew this would end in mass death and part of me wishes I had never started the show because of that. Going into the 8thbseason and my heart will be broken a dozen times over

Why is the dragons fire blue? It should still be red/orange right? Does that mean the dead army had blue blood if any at all?

I hope tormund doesn't die here at the wall, I hope when he dies it's fighting 

Who will kill the night king? Will he even lose? People were upset about the ending I know I'll be upset if he wins so it's a plausible theory

Cersi is a dumb bitch and I can't wait to see her die. Her pride/ignorance will kill countless people, she's one of the best villians and Lena Headey did a fantastic job playing her",game of thrones

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, it’s difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, Great payoffs for the characters and I especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the “main” character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, I never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, it’s the same snakes, other than them the season was…alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, I enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, i’ll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgi…theons arc was…okay

"DPLYR lead/lag with group by Do not understand why I the lead and lag functions ignore the group by.

Here's a simple example (in reality I need to group by 5 columns).

​

    order = c(3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4),
    value = c(15, 22, 43, 31, 25, 11, 37, 24, 18, 9))

​

""group""	""order""	""value""

""a""	3	15

""a""	4	22

""a""	2	43

""a""	5	31

""a""	1	25

""b""	1	11

""b""	3	37

""b""	4	24

""b""	2	18

""b""	4	9

&amp;#x200B;

Tried this but even the order by doesn't work here

    df %&gt;%
    group_by(group) %&gt;%
    mutate(previous = dplyr::lag(value, n=1, default=NA, order_by = order))

​

Then tried to arrange beforehand.

    df %&gt;% 
      arrange(group, order) %&gt;%
      group_by(group) %&gt;% 
      mutate(previous = dplyr::lag(value, n=1, default=NA))

""group""	""order""	""value""	""previous""

""a""	1	25	NA

""a""	2	43	25

""a""	3	15	43

""a""	4	22	15

""a""	5	31	22

""b""	1	11	31

""b""	2	18	11

""b""	3	37	18

""b""	4	24	37

""b""	4	9	24

&amp;#x200B;

Which fixes the sorting but is still ignoring the group by as b 1 should be NA not 31.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something obvious or can lag/lead and group\_by not be combined like this?

​

It would work in SQL with

`LAG(value, 1, NULL) OVER (PARTITION BY group ORDER BY order)`

An invented example: Mr. ML scientist programs a classifier to tell if a cat is pregnant based on the weight of the cat.  The classifier is relatively poor, but still has better than chance accuracy, 60% accuracy. And it doesn't require a nvidia GPU either, very cheap!

But I give ML's system a large (5 litre) bottle of water, and it concludes (based on the weight of course) that it is pregnant.


The question: shouldn't machine learning textbooks describe this situation somewhere in their introductory chapters? It is basic, fundamental issue, I think. I have looked, and thus far cannot find any descriptions. Surprised.

It seems obvious (imho) that reducing a classification of all possible objects through a feature that is a single number (weight) will have a vast number of false positives and false negatives. It reminds me of the null space, the infinite number of things that an operator cannot distinguish from zero. Thus the title.

Any thoughts?

"[Spoilers] Season 8 House of Undying Near the end of Season 2 when Khalessi is in the House of Undying searching for her Dragons, she walks into what looks like the Iron Throne.
Shortly before that she tells the Spice Merchant of Quarth that her dreams come to life. I hadn’t realized that the Iron Throne room she walks into is somewhat of a foreshadow? 
The room is cold and full of snow and she looks around at the roof to see the place looks destroyed. 
[spoiler coming up]
It’s crazy cause this looks like what she did to the Iron Throne when she rode in on her dragon and burned things down. (only instead of snowflakes all over the place, it was ashes I think)
I wonder if this was all planned by the writers given that the last couple of seasons were not exactly planned according to the books?
Hadn’t realized that her seeing what looks like the Iron Throne in the House of the Undying might be what happens near the end.

"Comment Dany's destiny was always going to be the same, for a simple reason. One of the main teachings of GoT is that power corrupts, and who's got more power than Daenerys? 

As much as I love her, Dany solved most if not all of the problems with one abilty: Raw Power. Not inteligence, not cunning, not strategy. Her military strategies were mostly made by the ""council"" that surrounded her. The only real exception I can think is the Dorathki leaders, but burning all of them alive is still more a power move than anything else. 

Point is, Dani has always been rudeless, and the bigger her dragons grew, the bigger her own ego did. You can see it in how she presents herself:

""Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons""

Even if she claimed she was different from the other lords, just like them she had grown to love being powerful.

 It is true, Daenerys was way more merciful to the common folk than any of the others, but at that her breaking point, she did what she had always done before: Destroy her enemies, with dragon fire. 

And people ask ""but she used to be so kind, and comppasionate"" Yeah, that was before she lost two of her sons , one of them thanks to cercei, and her best friend..... She was broken.

I honestly think that Daenerys going crazy is one of the things that will happen in the books. Obivously, with a slower burn that would make it more logical, but it will happens. Specially considering that in the books she has not only one, but TWO nephews that can contest her right to the throne: Jon and the real Aegon Taygaryen, the one born to Elia Martell.",game of thrones

"[SPOILERS] My opinion on the ending/ the whole show, as someone who hated the ‘medieval’ fantasy genre ok so i just finished the show about 10 minutes ago and i had to hop on here and say a few things.

as someone who cannot stand the fantasy genre ESPECIALLY when it’s in this time period, i think GOT was f******* amazing. the things that made it stand out to me from others is the vast amount of characters, the huge world, the lore, how unpredictable it is and more. there were moments that genuinely made me feel depressed, like the red wedding, or when i thought jon snow had died. just like there were moments that had my heart out of my chest with excitement. but you’ve heard all this im sure, so lets get to the juicy part.

the ending. i know for a fact everyone can agree that the ending was rushed. i haven’t read the books so i don’t know how quickly things happen, but it was rushed. daenerys went from angel to slaughtering thousands in the span of an episode which seriously made no sense to me. it made me lose any connection i had to her. 

i even thought the whole white walker saga was very odd. the whole show the white walkers were hyped up as this huge threat to the realm that we must band together and defeat. only for the final war to be done in an episode.

i seriously don’t understand how arya killed the night king. remember this is the same mf who survived the flames of a fully grown dragon and even fell off of one. only to be stabbed by arya. dont get me wrong i like arya, shes one of my fav characters but come on. the way it ended made me wonder, could the series have just done without white walkers. im ngl i was more interested in who would rule the kingdoms. 

i definitely dont think the ending is anywhere near as people are making it out to be. i can understand if you have following the series since the start, but ive seen people straight up telling ppl who havent watched it not to, because of how bad the ending is. the way i’d put it is this; the ending is not so bad when everyone around u is screaming in ur ear how bad it is.

Even after knowing the outcomes, the book still managed to hold my interest throughout, because the added details and character thoughts were so interesting. My favorite example of this is how in the season one finale, If I remember correctly, Dany kind of just walked into the flames, and emerged with three dragons. In the novel, there’s so much buildup and added layers to her motivations that it just works so much better. In her previous chapter, she dreamt of her family, and her true destiny as the blood of the dragon. When she saw her brother Rhaegar, “The Last Dragon,” she saw herself in the visor of his helm, proving that she was actually the true last dragon. I also loved how her dragons actually acted as her babies, feeding from her breasts. It just adds so much more to the name “Mother of Dragons.” Overall, it was such a good start to the book series, and I’m excited to keep reading.

"Question about rejecting outliers from a data set. I'm an astrophysics Ph.D student doing research on the stellar streams of the Milky Way. Part of my research involves finding new streams by finding moving groups of stars and then making an orbit fit.

In the process of fitting an orbit to stars, I reject any star that is a &gt;2-sigma outlier from a base orbit in at least one of three parameters (specific parameters vary from stream to stream, but are a combination of positions and velocities).

For the stream I'm currently attempting to fit, there are no stars that are 2-sigma outliers in individual parameters, but some are close to 2-sigma (~1.8 sigma) in two or three of the parameters. In order to figure out whether a given star can be rejected as an outlier, I calculated a chi-squared value for each star that is a sum of individual chi-squared values for each parameter, and then a p-value of whether or not the star is a member of the stream. That is:

x^2 _param = (expected value - observed value)^2 /expected value,

and then

x^2 _star = x^2 _param1 + x^2 _param2 + x^2 _param3

Doing this allows me to reject four stars.

Is this a valid method of rejecting outliers from a sample? Or am I missing something important? Intuitively, it seems reasonable, but I'm not adept enough with statistics to be certain.",data science
"How difficult would it be to run ~550000 iOS emulators simultaneously? I think I did the math right. 3^12 = 531441 according to a python shell.

"Doin a little Rstudio project for a game I like, need a little bit of help I'm pursuing a degree in data science atm, figure a good way to get into practice is to find practical applications and such. So I decided to try and tackle a mobile game I've been hooked on lately, and make use of statistics and correlation to figure out the most efficient way to unlock certain abilities. The game is Dragon City, and the mechanic I'm focusing on is Guardian Towers.

Here's the quick run-down: You need to assemble all the pieces of a tower in order to awaken its dragon and get its abilities. You can send up to 4 of your dragons at a time on a ""mission"" to attempt to recover a piece, and once a few hours pass you either get it or don't. Here's the crux: dragons have elements/types much like pokemon, except each one can have up to 4 rather than 2. On the dragon select screen, there's a list of 3-4 elements that are desired, and the closer your dragons' elements match up the better your odds of success get. After each attempt, it cycles through several different sets of elements. Most relevant information can be found here: [https://dragoncity.fandom.com/wiki/Towers](https://dragoncity.fandom.com/wiki/Towers)(My focus is primarily going to be on the last 3; Speedy/Greedy, Broodby and Phaun, since they're significantly more difficult than the previous towers and are also the ones I'm currently stuck on)

I've gone ahead and whipped up a csv with all the data on how often each element is required. Here's an idea of the format: [https://imgur.com/a/IkO46BM](https://imgur.com/a/IkO46BM)

Each letter on top represents an element(you can probably guess what a few of them are lol), and for the rows we have a letter indicating the guardian in question, then the tower tier(1-3), then the member of the element rotation(1-7). Each tier has its own set of 7, once you gather enough pieces it moves on to the next. 1 simply means the element is part of the group, while 0 means it isn't. (I've already done the first tier of S/G so didn't feel the need to include it)

Now that I've got the data, there's a few things I'd like to do with it… unfortunately I don't have much of an understanding of R's machinations. Pretty experienced at coding in general, I just don't know the functions and techniques that get me to the places I wanna be. That's all the help I really need here.

What I'd like to do:

\- create an array of the total amounts of times each element appears (starting simple)

\- make a table of the correlations each element has with each other element to see which ones appear together the most

\- Maybe output a ranking of combinations of 3-4 elements that would have the most success overall if feasible

The over-arching objective here is to determine what specific dragons I should aim to get in order to boost the odds as much as possible. Gonna see if the community has data for the dragon dex prepared somewhere so that I can really get a nice clean calculator going, but I think the search function in game will suffice for now.

"[D] Wandering into the ML winter So... I have a PhD in quantum physics and a couple of years of experience at a startup. I want to get a research position in machine learning (uni or industry). Whats the best move reddit ML?

I assume it will be impossible to get ML Postdoc positions without at least one ML publication. Also an ML PhD sounds like a lot of fun, but feels like the wrong move since I already have a PhD. What type of industry jobs would a) accept me and b) allow me to move towards doing real research and publishing papers?

Bonus Question: Apparently ""winter is coming"" (as one ML professor warned me). I think the field will is still capable of producing a massive amount of fundamental progress and real applications over the next 30-50 years. At the same time the massive overhype around AI seems to have made an AI winter inevitable. What do you think? Which industry areas and research topics survive this, and which are all hot air?

*Background on me:* During my PhD I did Quantum experiments, Math/simulations and some fancy statistics (compressed sensing). I have a bunch of papers (9 ish) some in very high-impact journals, but all in Physics, not ML.  At the startup, I have built imaging and statistical inference code for a sensor.

8. Red Wanderer sacred to Smith of the Seven - Mars maybe? Ygritte called it Thief, but we know only one thief in the sky, Orion. Ygritte :""when the thief was in the Moonmaid, that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman"". So it's a wandering ""star"" that crosses the figures, ie a planet. Mars?

"Live object classification from a Raspberry Pi. Training on my PC/GPU - I did my research, but still have a few question about which direction to take - Keras, training set, live-feed, etc... Hello everyone.

I want to use my Raspberry Pi + Pi Camera v2 as a real time/live object-detector for things I have trained it for. Example: I have an apple, a banana and an orange, I hold it in front of my Pi camera and it automatically detects the correct fruit, gives out the fruit's name on a LCD display along with the corresponding accuracy estimation.

I'm not completely new to ML/DL, so I don't need step-by-step directions on how to do it exactly, I just need to be pointed in the right direction for a few problems I'm facing. Most of it is due to a lack of experience.

My questions are:

1. I can do all this with static images that are stored on my hard-drive. I chose Keras and I've built a CNN model for it. When researching this topic. I found a lot of OpenCV tutorials and blog posts. It seems as if OpenCV is mostly used for things like edge-detection, but not really for object classification. Did I conclude this correctly or am I wrong and OpenCV would be better suited than a CNN here?
2. I know how to train a model and use the trained model on a new set of images, but how do I do this with a live-video feed? I want this to work as close to real-time as possible, so speed (along with accuracy of course) is definitely a top priority. I can use my Raspberry Pi camera to i.e. take 10 still images per second, but how do I manage this behind the scenes? Is there a tool or framework that takes care of this? Is there just a simple Python loop I can write and I cannot think of at the moment? How do I make sure that the fruit gets detected in time before the loop of 10 images is overwritten? I hope it is clear what my problem is here. If not, please let me know so I can clarify.
3. The fruit-images I have on my hard-drive look ""significantly"" different than the images/video from the Raspberry camera. But manually taking 1000 photos of apples/bananas/... from my Raspberry Pi camera seems overkill :-). Are images from the actual camera vital? Meaning will I even get decent accuracy if I use ""normal"" photos of fruits to train my model and then use the live images from my Raspberry Pi Camera for live detection? I have a feeling that this could be a (significant) problem.

"Comment I would do exactly as she did, just not in way she did it. 

Let’s see, Sansa is a girl who just got her family’s home back, after years of being abused by other people who just used her. She’s weary of everyone because although she has the support from the northerners, she still fears people want to take Winterfell from the Starks again. Her brother, Robb, and her mother, Catelyn, died fighting for the North’s independence causing the beginning of the fall of House Stark. She believes her half brother Jon is the key to fulfilling Robb’s dreams to turn the North in an independent kingdom, a cause that, again, he died for. Jon goes to Daenerys as King in the North and comes back calling her Queen of the Seven Kingdoms… 

Sansa doesn’t know Danny, as far as she is concerned she is a foreigner who didn’t even grow up in Westeros and now comes to take back her mad father’s throne, the man who killed her grandfather and her uncle. Of course you shouldn’t judge someone based on their family’s mistakes or evilness, but there is literally a common saying in Westeros that says Targaryens have a tendency for madness (“everytime a Targaryen is born the Gods flip a coin”) and let’s not forget that Sansa’s personality is extremely influenced by Cersei who treated everyone as an enemy. So, Daenerys arrives at Winterfell with three dragons and somehow she managed to convince Jon to give up on his “King in the North” claim… of course Sansa doesn’t like this, she wanted the North’s independence and in her mind Danny was the responsible for Jon giving up on the North’s independence. When Sansa asked Danny what did the dragon’s eat she answered “they eat whatever they want”… like, girl the dragons are yours, their your responsibility and you went through a certain previous situation where you got to know how dangerous they were to people who are not you. Danny’s answer should’ve been less “agressive” and more reassuring that she would take care of it and make sure the dragons didn’t hurt anyone, that’s how a leader should answer (of course I know all of this and the shitty dialogue was due to the bad writing but unfortunately it’s what we have so I have to base my opinion on it). 

So, you have a “queen” that convinced your brother to give up on the North’s independence, a “queen” who apparently didn’t give a shit about her dragons eating people or not, a “queen” who you’ve heard takes no prisoners and burns alive whoever doesn’t bend the knee to her… besides thinking Daenerys wouldn’t be a good queen, Sansa knew she was the only one standing in the middle of the North’s independence, with Danny out of the picture she could finally get what she wanted and avenge her family’s deaths. With this said, yes, I would do exactly as Sansa did, but I guess I wouldn’t be as sneaky as she was (although that was something she learned from Littlefinger, another character who strongly influenced her). 

Ps: I know it sounds a lot like I hate Danny but I promise I don’t xD I’m just imagining myself in Sansa’s position.",game of thrones

"[Spoilers] just finished s6 and am worried about the amount of action left So after s6 the only threats to Daenerys in Westeros are Cercei and Jon. Every other great leader introduced in previous seasons is dead or teamed up with Daenerys. I’m worried there won’t me much of a “game” left for the throne and it’ll be a cakewalk for Daenerys and then everyone teams against the white walkers.

That would suck to me because the pvp for the throne was the interesting part of the show, not the battle against emotionless zombies like some sort of tower defense game or CoD zombies.

"[spoilers] How would Danerys have conquered Westeros if Tyrion didn't turn stupid in season 7? I'm in my yearly re-watch and I'm at the point where I'm drudging my way through season 7, and I got back to thinking - how would Danerys' conquest have gone if Tyrion hadn't started taking stupid pills? Here's my thought -   
Step 1: Upon striking the alliance with Dorne and the Tyrells, immediately march the Dornish army to Highgarden to combine their strength. Tyrion should know that the Lannister army would outmatch the Tyrells on their own if Cersei went on the offensive.  
Step 2: Deploy the Dothraki, commanded by Tyrion, to liberate the Riverlands and strike an alliance with Edmure Tully and the Riverlords. Then have the Dothraki capture and occupy Harrenhall so they're positioned on the mainland if they're needed again.  
Step 3: Sail the Greyjoy and Unsullied fleets together to the western sea, guarded by Danerys and 2 dragons (1 dragon remains with Missandei to guard Dragonstone), to find and kill Euron Greyjoy and capture or destroy his fleet. Tyrion should so, so, so obviously have known that Euron was their biggest military threat.  
Step 4: Once Euron is defeated, send the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock. Theon then takes the Unsullied ships to retake the Iron Islands. Danerys and Yara recover the Tyrell treasury and supplies from Highgarden and take them back to Dragonstone for safe keeping.  
Step 5: Embark Varys on a secret mission to the Stormlands to find out what the hell has been going on there since Stannis sailed north and if there are any allies to be found. If not, march the Tyrell and Dornish armies to Storm's End to take the castle and stage them for the siege of King's Landing.  
Step 6: Surround King's Landing with the Dornish and Tyrells from the south and east, the Tullys from the north, and the Greyjoy fleet from the sea. Having captured all the top fortresses in the kingdom, there's no one left to stop her.

"Starting a Small Analytics Consulting Company. Easy or Hard? I want to start off by saying that I am not an expert in my field. I'm good at some of the most fundamental tools in analytics (SQL, R, Tableau, making intelligent/actionable insights from data). I also am not this hype boy entrepreneur. However, I've always liked the idea of starting a small analytics company of just me and a friend who might have similar skills. 

The opportunity I see is that a lot small business (think a bakery, a small shipping company, or a retailer that sells bracelets) don't have the ability to capture insights from their data. Sure, there is a lot of software out there that can provide with a summary of sales, unit of sales, etc. But sometimes when I enter a small bakery my mind starts running on how this business owner can optimize their pastry offerings on a given day and on the certain types of customers that visit that day, pricing elasticity with their products, and many other things especially if you start to understand their pain points. 

I would imagine there might be some people who might say to just join UpWork if you want to make side money. Thing is I have, and I was given a rising star badge because of my portfolio, but I haven't really enjoyed any of the opportunities and there is more opportunity to discover.

"[Spoilers] Can you make a list of the most evil characters from the series?  

So, for those of you who don\`t know there is a trope created by TV Tropes called Complete Monster (also known as Pure Evil). They are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. There are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:

1. The character has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he/she could still become a Complete Monster if he/she loses them. Even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.
2. The character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. We also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. This means that if a character has more resources (if for example he/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. If a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he/she is a lone serial killer), then he/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. If a character\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster. The character\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a Complete Monster:

\- The baseline standard - This is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. This means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is REALLY extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).

\- The standards of the work - This means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his/her actions are bad enough to make him/her stand out. This means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like My Little Pony needs to be compared to other villains from My Little Pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as Warhammer 40000, A Song of Ice and Fire and Berserk. Similarly, a villain who comes from a work with high heinous standard should  be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not to villains that come from My Little Pony.

\- The resource standard - This means that we should also take into consideration the villain\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as I already mentioned.

\- The system standard - This means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the Galactic Empire for example)

3) The character\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he/she has either no excuse for his/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. Even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his/her personality, it doesn\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\`t try to make you feel sorry for them. In short, this means that the audience is not supposed to feel ANY SYMPATHY for the character.

4) The character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. This means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed, made of evil or from a race or culture that can\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\`t qualify. However, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the Joker).

5) The character is portrayed seriously and is not a Comic Relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). Even if the character is funny he/she can still be a Complete Monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. If the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\`s shows), then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

6) The character must make AT LEAST ONE APPEARANCE in the story itself. Characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearance can\`t qualify. Aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen/off-page and are only vaguely described, then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

7) The audience is not supposed to feel bad for a Complete Monsterr when something bad happens to him/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the Complete Monster.

8) The character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than ""bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason"" type of plot. A horror film or book can still contain a Complete Monster but it needs to have some plot. For this reasons films like Human Centipede and Serbian Film don\`t contain Complete Monsters because they are viewed by TvTropes as plotless exploitation even though the villains are extremely repulsive.

9) A character must meet ALL of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a Complete Monster.

Now, I will copy and paste a list of all the characters that are listed as Complete Monsters in the series:

* [Joffrey Baratheon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesJoffreyBaratheon) is a dyed-in-the-wool sadist who seems to take pleasure only in fear and suffering. At first putting on a [charming face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing), his true colors are hinted at when he begins carving up the face of Arya Stark's lowborn friend for fun, before trying to kill Arya herself for hitting him, despite the fact she's the younger sister of his fiancée, Sansa. After becoming king, however, Joffrey really comes into his own as a vicious bastard, ordering Ned Stark's execution even though it ensures a civil war with the North. Viewing Sansa as his toy, he frequently has her [humiliated, beaten and threatened with death and rape.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse) Among his many cruel acts, Joffrey has a bard choose between losing his hands or his tongue, tries to drown Ser Dontos with wine, orders a crowd of peasants executed because one threw some dung at him, forces one prostitute to beat another, possibly to death, at crossbow point, and eventually shoots Ros full of crossbow bolts just to experience what it's like to personally kill someone. The taboo of kin killing means little to Joffrey either, as he threatened to [execute his mother](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide) for slapping him, tried to have his uncle Tyrion assassinated, and had his bastard siblings (including [children and babies](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild)) butchered so no one would notice [how little Joffrey resembled his supposed father](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard), Robert Baratheon. In the end, Joffrey was merely a [vicious, idiot king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat) who believed [ruling meant everyone was his to torment.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula)
* [Ser Gregor Clegane](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseClegane), the Mountain, is [the most feared knight in Westeros](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded) and [works for](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire) Tywin Lannister and his family. A violent sadist who had once [burned his brother's face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully) for playing with one of his toys, Gregor is introduced in the Hand's tournament where he murders another contender via splintered lance; when Loras Tyrell manages to unhorse him, Gregor slaughters his own horse for failing him and attempts to murder Loras. When Gregor's own brother interferes, Gregor tries to kill him as well. When next seen, Gregor is head of the occupying Lannister forces at Harrenhal where he selects prisoners to be tortured to death by one of his men known as [the Tickler](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician). When Harrenhal is lost, Gregor has every prisoner put to the sword, leaving hundreds of corpses for the next arrivals to find. In season 4, Gregor is seen practicing his sword skills by butchering prisoners in wholly one-sided duels before he enters into a Trial by Combat representing the Crown against Prince Oberyn Martell who wishes to force Gregor to confess to the murder of Oberyn's sister Elia and her children. When Gregor gets his hands on Oberyn, he [shoves his thumbs through the prince's eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream) before [squeezing his head until it explodes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode), wanting to hurt the man as much as possible while he roars out his guilt in [killing the children](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild) before he raped and murdered Elia.
* [Craster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard) is a particularly nasty [Wildling](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesWildlings) who resides beyond the Wall, making his living as an ally to the Night's Watch by providing them with supplies, shelter and info. Craster delights in antagonizing them, however, hiding behind the fact he's necessary to them to avoid reprisal. What makes Craster sickening is how he rules his self-given kingdom: Craster routinely [marries any daughters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry) he has when they come of age, [beating and raping his many wives and daughter-wives](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest). If they bear him sons, Craster [sacrifices them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice) by leaving them out for the White Walkers. Craster threatens violence on those he can't simply cow into submission and relishes the lack of law beyond the Wall to simply do whatever he wants, even having the audacity to claim he is a ""Godly man"" when criticized.
* [Ramsay Snow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesRamsayBolton), the bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton and the most vicious member of House Bolton, is a sadist with a knack for torture and [flaying others alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlayedAlive). After capturing Winterfell, Ramsay proceeded to play [twisted games](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape) with the captive Theon Greyjoy, pretending to be an Ironborn agent who comes to save Theon—killing his own men to keep up the ruse—and culminating in Ramsay bringing Theon to the Dreadfort and subjecting him to prolonged, hideous torture, including [flaying bits of him](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore) and [castrating](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingCastration) him. All that remains of Theon afterwards is a broken, obedient shell whom Ramsay dubs ""Reek."" In his spare time, Ramsay and his equally psychotic lover [Myranda](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMistress) release girls into the woods to hunt them for sport, also using the girls to feed Ramsay's savage hounds. When Ramsay makes Theon negotiate a surrender with other Ironborn, Ramsay guarantees their safety, [only to have them flayed alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied) and displayed as gruesome trophies. After marrying Sansa Stark, Ramsay rapes her on the wedding night and continues to [sexually and physically abuse her](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse) throughout the rest of the marriage. Ramsay cements his rule over his hold by murdering Roose and having his hounds eat his infant brother and stepmother. When he finally engages the Northern armies, Ramsay is [apathetic to the death of his own men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves) and shoots the preteen Rickon Stark dead—moments before he reaches Jon Snow. With few matching his pointless savagery, Ramsay Snow exemplified every [negative stereotype about bastards](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard) in Westeros.
* [Lord Walder Frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare), head of [House Frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseFrey), is a [smug](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake) old man who nevertheless appears to be little more than a doddering but harmless [pervert](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan) before the true depths of his treachery are made apparent. In alliance with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton, Walder organizes the [Red Wedding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers) and [oversees the deaths of Robb Stark, his pregnant wife Talisa, Catelyn, and the near-entirety of their bannermen](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GameOfThronesS3E9TheRainsOfCastamere) in a full-on massacre whilst nonchalantly drinking from a cup of wine—for the sake of power and getting back at Robb for breaking his wedding vow. Walder coldly dismisses the life of his teenage wife once Catelyn takes her hostage with the logic of ""I'll find another"" and doesn't so much as blink when her throat is cut in front of him. Walder is entirety unrepentant about his betrayal and destructive fallout caused by it, and [cruelly gloats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating) about his victory and the new position of power he's snagged for the rest of his role in the series. Walder is a coward and a backstabber who considers even age-old traditions like [guest right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality) irrelevant in the face of personal gain, and is rightfully detested even in the cutthroat world of Westeros for his treason.
* [Karl Tanner](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy) is a [Night's Watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesNightsWatch) member who takes the [taboo of oathbreaking](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker) to extreme measures by instigating a mutiny in Craster's Keep which claims the lives of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and all of his loyalists. After taking over at Craster's Keep, Karl rules with an iron fist, drinks wine from the skull of the very commander he betrayed, relishes his past as a [Psycho for Hire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire), and pressures his men to rape and brutalize Craster's wives/daughters, who are [too terrified of Karl's violent outbursts](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded) to oppose him. When one of Craster's wives steps in with the last-born baby boy, Karl's first reaction is to [attempt to kill it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild) for not wanting any more mouths to feed. He's only stopped when the wives point out that they leave them as a sacrifice for the White Walkers, so he has that done instead. Once his men captures Bran and his group, Karl abuses Bran and menaces Meera in order to get him to speak, later attempting to gang-rape Meera with his men while [forcing her brother to watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch). When encountered by Jon Snow, Karl shows nothing but pride for his treachery and relishes the time he and his men had as free men, [despite mocking Craster for the same lifestyle a while back](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite).

The most evil characters according to these criteria are Joffrey, Gregor, Craster, Ramsay, Walder Frey and Karl Tanner. The other characters are not listed because they don't meet the criteria to be called Pure Evil.

"[SPOILERS] What I would have done differently So its been a while since season 8 now and I've thought a lot since then about what I would change to the show if I was the one to write it.

A lot of people thought Dani's change to mad queen was rushed and I still think it was a smidge but after rewatching the signs are all there for her gradual decline into madness so I wouldn't change that.

At the battle for winterfell I think Jamie should have died, as it would have completed his redemption arc, dying while fighting in winterfell along with the North, the same place he pushed bran out the window. Would have been a meaningful moment for him to die defending brienne who in my opinion he loved more than cersei.

Also a few more major characters should have died in the battle, seemed a bit lackluster for me that the named characters that did die like lady mormont and the night watch commander (can't remember his name) were small roles, the biggest loss was probably jorah and theon but with it being the long night, the thing that had been teased from day 1, it should have been a lot more deadly.

With Jamie's death it would open up the possibility for arya to use Jamie's face to return to kings landing and finally kill cersei after years of waiting, the show could have pulled a massive misdirect and only shown Jamie's death as a flashback when he(arya) kills cersei. There could be a few scene of jamie and briene travelling to kings landing and talking about what they are going to do after it was all over of whatever, but we don't know it's arya at that point, something like that.

How excatly arya would kill cersei I've yet to decide but it would either be really brutal or really emotional and meaningful, or both I guess, but it would be a better death for Jamie and cersei, rather than ya know, getting crushed by some rubble caused by Dani going full mad queen.

Which leaves the death of the night King up to someone else so that ayra doesn't seem massively OP, maybe bran could weaken the night king somehow because they are supposed to have a deep connection, maybe he could have actually been the bait all along but not in the way he explained to the others, and that would leave the night king weak enough for theon to take him down, completing his redemption arc, helping save the boy who he once lied about burning alive. 

With theon surviving, and the iron islands no longer needing to be held by yara incase of the loss of the long night, theon and yara could be at the battle of kings landing fighting off against Euron so the battle took place over land and sea and seemed like a larger scale battle, the fight between Jamie and euron that happened in the show would be replaced with Euron and yara, euron would probably win in a straight fight but something could happen to turn the tide, maybe theon could be ramming cannon fire into the ship they are fighting on and euron gets caught by some debris, then ultimately yara ends up winning and killing euron and becomes the first queen of the iron islands after the battle.

I love the show and although the last season isn't on par with the rest I still really liked it but I feel like it could have been better, interested to see if you guys agree that any of this sounds better, or what if anything you would change about it.",game of thrones

Most tutorials seemed aimed at the individual usually a advertorial more than actually informative and the few informative ones tend to be aimed for bloggers/hustlers(scammers)/ and other solo endeavors rather than a small business in a professional context. 

So I can read analytics in the way I can read books but I have no idea what to do with what I'm reading. I might as well be reading a cake recipe made by NASA's second cousin that went to community college. There's a lot there for the general masses but nothing specific or actionable in a business wherein the person checking the SEO/Analytics data to act upon. 

SEO itself seems too common sense really to be called something other than an English major or copywriter,But with a data overlay.
 

 So I'm curious --a semi-newbie in a business learning on the job What do you do that actionable other than potentially spamming in a backlink email quest.  ",data science

She turns to fire on an expected soldier only to realize it wasn't a soldier who fired the shot, it was a woman and her child. They look on at Dany in fear and anger. Dany looks around as the bells begin to further distort as the number of them ring. She begins to see pockets of civilians lookin on at her, screaming at her, waving their hand in anger. This is what it takes to finally push Dany over into ""Fire and Blood"" she's tired of listening to advisors at the detriment of her own cause. She's lost her two children, her closest and best friends, her lover, and now? After showing mercy to a ungrateful and unwanted people that she was told would welcome her with open arms, realizes that too was a lie.

"Is my cGPA or latest GPA good enough for grad school in Statistics? Hi there,

I am a current 4th year student in Statistics with Economics and Mathematics at UofT. As of right now, my cGPA is 2.91 (not the best cGPA). Although in my last 1.5 years (last 3 semesters starting 3rd year courses), I have a GPA of 3.26 but I'm not finished this yet.

I had problems adjusting to the University lifestyle in my first two years and have gotten better recently. I suspect that I may have a learning disability (like ADHD/ADD) considering that I had a medical condition (cancer) when I was a toddler and affected my hearing disability. Not using it as an excuse because I still own up for my struggles.

I am hoping to get a masters in Statistics to work in industry for Statistics work (Statistician or Data Science or Quantitative Finance). 

Is my cGPA or latest GPA good enough? I do have a lot of electives in my remaining degree. Should I boost my GPA with irrelevant courses to be considered or should I take courses related to the masters program? I still have a couple more courses to complete my major/minor requirements.

I am planning to add research experience at UofT too and taking an extra year. I have work experience at University as a Research Assistant and am part of a Quantitative Finance Statistics project at UofT.

Please let me know any advice about my situation as it will be appreciated.

My backup plan if grad school doesn't work out is to become an Actuary (but I haven't started passing any exams yet since my parents wanted me to wait until I finished University). It is great but I also like other applications of Statistics.

"[D] Fake results on a paper of NeurIPS 2021 ML4AD Workshop ? Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

 I was reading the workshop's paper : ""How Far Can I Go?: A Self-Supervised Approach for Deterministic Video Depth Forecasting"". and I have some concerns about it.  


The major concern is the results of their forecasting in Table 1 outperform the current state of art of depth estimation without future forecasting which is not theoretically possible. The qualitative results in Figure 4 do not support that claim: the network has simply copied the last frame and did not learn any dynamics.   
The Same observation could be observed for the competitor  \[36\] \[14\] even though it is reported that these networks outperform the current state of the art, the qualitative in Figure 4 results are very bad and do not support that claim.  


Other concerns are :  
The eigen split is not 22600/888/667 train/val/test. The SOTA reports on the test set but the paper reports on the validation set.   


KITTI dataset is 10fps therefore the Figure 5 does not match the reported results of  Table 1. 5 frames in the future correspond to 0.5 second.  


They have not mentioned if they have remimented \[36\] \[14\]. Their corresponding papers do not evaluate on similar metrics and no other references are provided for their evaluation.  
and many other concerns.  


This paper sets the lower bound on the forecasting error that is not even possible without forecasting this could slow down the research on that area. What do you think about such results ? ",data science

"[NO SPOILERS] Finally reading the first ASOIAF novel and.. It’s actually really good so far.

1) As someone who watched the show I can’t help but mentally compare certain things in the show to the tv. Books always best the shows in the sense that it has more depth. But honestly it’s hard to visualize the characters as explained by George when the actors looked a little different. Joffrey is freaking TALL with blonde curls as well as other Lannisters? Daenerys has violet eyes? Tyrione has two different eye colors? Robb has auburn Tully hair? Jon snow and brown hair? Arrya has a long face and not a round one? Ik it’s minor but I can’t visualize them as anything but what I saw in the show. 

2) George is a master of describing the world of the story. The emotions, settings, actions. Paints a clear picture and has a way with words. Like how he introduced Daenerys was iconic. 

“Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water”. 

But I feel like he kind of over does it other times. Not every detail in my opinion needs to be vividly described. Beautifully said but it starts to feel like he’s trying to fill up pages instead of getting to the point. 

3) And speaking of Dany, seeing how down bad and weak she was in the beginning and how she will grow as the series progresses is what makes her arguably the best character in the series. Interested in seeing how George will handle her “descent into madness” arc differently than the show, I assume a bit slower. 

But overall I enjoy it as someone who has a good 500+ pages left. Interested in reading the other books as well.",game of thrones

Comment How is this so far down?!,game of thrones
"Comment Takes a drastic turn in season 8. Dany needed more time or nothing really has any weight. Which to me the whole season outside of 2 scenes lacks any real weight or care. It's good looking (sometimes) but I had almost no investment anymore and the entertainment I got from it was more so comedic rather than dramatic.

I'm surprised the story continued after the wight walkers tbh. But after them the dothraki who are now leaderless, the riverlands are in chaos, the reach and the westerlands in open rebellion, the Dornish and Iron islanders receding, the north is devastated, Daario's control over Mereen slipping there's plenty of ways to go tbh. But ehhhh idk if season 8 stays the same I can't say I'd be dying for a season 9. And the writers killed or wrote off any characters that didn't contribute to the main plot so you'd have to build up new ones. The story could continue but after season 8 I think it's better it didn't. Forgetting this story and focusing on the dance of dragons or anything else would be much better.",game of thrones

"Adam works but SGD doesn't Hi, I'm building a model to classify whether or not a twitter user is likely to follow my accounts based on who they follow. The model is just an embeding bag (it computes the mean of  embeddings, that belong to the twiter accounts that user is following) and passes ir through a linear layer with a sigmoid activation function at the end.

I tried a lot of different things to make my model work, like adding regularization, changing learning rates, adding neurons/layers, but the only thing that seems to make the model learn is using the Adam optimizer. Adam is getting me around 70% accuracy and SGD around 52% (almost doesnt learn at all). The dataset is balanced and with the Adam optimizer the loss gradually lowers until it converges.

From reading about this topic it seems like it should be the opposite, people say SGD works better than Adam, but in my cause SGD does not work at all... Why is this happening?

"[No Spoilers] Need input for a homemade Game of Thrones board game I'm working on a homebrew board game that is war for Westeros, and I had a something I was uncertain of, and wanted to get input from people with more information about GOT lore. I don't want to get into too details of the game that aren't relevant for this post. Troops will move between cities/villages on the map, and it will involve naval movement between cities as well as movement on land. I have some cities that I'm not sure whether or not they should count as ports that are accessible by sea. I don't mean that it is a trade port, but whether that city/village would have been accessible to a naval force for purposes of troop movement. Karhold, Dreadfort, Barrowton, Highgarden, Blackmoat, Hellholt, Honeyhold, Godsgrace, and Vulture's Roost are all along Rivers that come from the sea. Are any of these along rivers big enough for a boat/landing party to traverse that they should be considered accessible? Some cities/villages that are close to the sea, but not right on it are Mistwood, Yronwood, Old Oak, and Crakehall, so I wasn't sure if these should be accessible or not either. Those are the cities I am curious about, please let me know which you think should be accessible by sea.

"[NO SPOILERS] Let's Make Game of Thrones Great Again! (one chapter at a time...) | Season 6, Chapter 6: RAYMAR this is the ongoing FULL REWRITE of the last 2 seasons and a half (starting from season 6)

**Title:** Season 6, Chapter 6: RAYMAR

**Author:** David Melies (FF) (Medium) (WattPad) (AO3)

**Language:** English

**Rating:** Mature

**Length:** 6 Chapters. 32,420 words. Ongoing.

**Summary:**  
I’m particularly proud of this one…. This chapter is the most personal I've written yet.  
Raymar is a brand new protagonist, that I wrote from scratch, (he doesn't exist in the show/books) within a new storyline, filled with other original characters, that I believe not only blends seamlessly with the show's storyline, but actually makes it more significant.

But you'll be the judge of that :) I'm excited to read what you think!

"Zindi's official response to claims of unfair treatment by u/maroxtn *An official response to* [*this post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mdlnvy/everything_wrong_with_zindi_data_science/)*.*

My name is Paul Kennedy, I am Zindi’s Community and Communication Manager ([LinkedIn profile for reference](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-paul-kennedy-/)). I and my colleagues at Zindi were disappointed to read this comment, and I would like to take the time to address the principal claims made in the above post. We take cheating on the platform very seriously, as it erodes trust for all our users.

***Claim 1:*** *I opened my email thinking it was some sort of a mistake, I found an email sent by them stating that they banned me under the pretext of ""Collaboration outside of team"". I responded explaining to them that I single handedly worked on the solution of my problem, telling them I'm ready to provide proof if they want. They didn't respond.*

The user in question (and the author of this post) was banned from the [AI4D iCompass Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Tunisian Arabizi Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-icompass-social-media-sentiment-analysis-for-tunisian-arabizi) for contravening rule 2.2 of the platform (Please see our [Rules page](https://zindi.africa/rules); these rules are also replicated in every competition page):

*2.2. Multiple accounts per user are not permitted, and neither is collaboration or membership across multiple teams. Individuals and their submissions originating from multiple accounts will be immediately disqualified from the platform.*

The user was given a first offence warning and removed from the challenge on 19 March 2021, as per Rule 7.1:

*7.1.* ***First offence: No prizes or points for 6 months (probation period)****. If you are caught cheating, all individuals involved in cheating will be disqualified from the challenge(s) you were caught in and you will be disqualified from winning any competitions or Zindi points for the next six months.*

***Claim 2:*** *Then today, out of sheer luck, I discovered that the team that took my place on the leaderboard when I got banned work as a data scientist for Zindi, which is quite preposterous to say the least.*

This is an utterly false and baseless claim. As per Rule 1 of the Zindi platform, employees of Zindi are not allowed to participate in any competition on Zindi. Further, any contracted individual may not participate in any competition that they worked on and helped to prepare:

1. *Participation*
   1. *All members of the public are permitted to participate in any Zindi competition, unless:*
      1. *They are a full-time or contracted employee of Zindi, or an immediate family member of a full-time or contracted employee of Zindi*
      2. *They are a full-time, contracted employee, or intern at the host company of the specific competition*
      3. *Individuals may not participate in a specific challenge if they have helped design the challenge, source and prepare the data, or if they are/will be involved in code review.*

Lastly, I’d like to express my sadness and regret at the awful sentiments expressed in the post above regarding ‘everything wrong with African countries’. As a company, we distance ourselves from such bigoted remarks. Zindi is dedicated to growing, supporting and uplifting Africa through the transformative potential of data science and machine intelligence. We are, at our heart, a company dedicated to making AI accessible to African and other developing countries. We strive every day to promote fair and ethical data science as a career choice, a technology for disruptive positive change, and a movement that will reshape the African landscape for decades and centuries to come. We have hope and optimism for Africa and for African data science. We are constantly inspired and motivated by the amazing work of our African and non-African users. Anyone who shares these sentiments is welcome on our platform, and is invited to join us in building AI together, for everyone, and for good.",data science

Sansa not telling Jon that Vale were coming.

Not arming the giant. (What would it take to chop a tree so the giant could wield it?He could swoop the infantry circle..)

Jon's extra thicc plot armor. He fucking survived a barrage of arrows, his horse turned into a fucking cheese grater but somehow, he survived. (What was he thinking anyways?)

There is no way those bodies would pile up like that in an open battlefield.

Jon's suffocation was a cool scene... IF IT WASN'T 30 MINUTES LONG.

An experienced archer such as Ramsay not aiming for Jon's legs when he has his shield up during their ""1v1"".

Ramsay shooting the giant instead of Jon. (You may argue that he wanted a proper duel with Jon but come on. We all know what Ramsay is.He is not much for honor.)

Overall it was a ""Hero gets beaten then gets saved by someone they didn't expect."" cliche.

What are the best projects I could write in this scenario ? I was thinking of doing some projects only involving Pandas and Numpy, as I don't know ML yet as said. Another idea was maybe making some game with Pygame.

Please tell me what you think (what project, or something else involving programming, is in your opinion best in this scenario).",data science

"[P] Update--using an Orbbec Astra Pro, improved tracking, and again the dynamixel Pan/Tilt turret, ROS and YOLOv3 for realtime robotic object tracking https://youtu.be/QoP2Hu_RQcU

Above is an update to an ongoing ""Applied-ML"" project of mine.

There is still a lot of work to do to get the SLAM components of this working properly, but I have recently made significant improvements to a robotic turret that uses ROS, a Dynamixel pan/tilt turret, and YOLOv3 to track objects in real time in 3D using the 2D detection from YOLO.  In this video it's again tracking ""Human heads"".

The detection is much smoother in this release, although at about :12 in the video here, it jolts hard to the right in error  (likely an error in lead and/or speed update, should be easy to resolve).

YOLO performs significantly better on the NVidia Tesla k40 that I'm using here as well, upgraded from the GTX1060 in my previous post.  I'm also using a calibrated Orbbec Astra Pro instead of the Kinect 360 as well.  The depth registration of the RGB as well as the stability of the detection has noticably improved.

I plan to begin the challenge of designing a rudimentary implementation of ""visual dialogue"" with this in another upcoming upgrade.  Ideally I want this to be able to not just hold a conversation, but be able to look around the room at objects that it's capable of detecting and using SLAM to store the location of those (an example being ""what is that cat behind you doing?"" and have it respond with looking for the cat, tracking and mapping it's location, and generating a verbal response).

Stay tuned for more updates; the next will be a bit more exciting!

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00067.pdf)

Abstract:

Recent methods generalize convolutional layers from Euclidean domains to graph-structured data by approximating the eigenbasis of the graph Laplacian. The computationally-efficient and broadly-used Graph ConvNet of Kipf &amp; Welling, over-simplifies the approximation, effectively rendering graph convolution as a neighborhood-averaging operator. This simplification restricts the model from learning delta operators, the very premise of the graph Laplacian. In this work, we propose a new Graph Convolutional layer which mixes multiple powers of the adjacency matrix, allowing it to learn delta operators. Our layer exhibits the same memory footprint and computational complexity as a GCN. We illustrate the strength of our proposed layer on both synthetic graph datasets, and on several real-world citation graphs, setting the record state-of-the-art on Pubmed.",data science

"Looking for cost-of-living comparison that is income-dependent. I am looking for a cost-of-living comparison for the US that is as comprehensive as possible. For example, states that don't have any personal income tax may make up for that with higher property taxes (on a county/municipal level), higher sales tax (again, on county/municipal level) or other higher costs. For example, Alaska has no personal income tax, but has about the highest costs of living. So just by going by the state's income tax would be an incomplete calculation. So taxation must be part of the comparison, but then the comparison is income-dependent.

"Why do so many famous people die in small airplane crashes? Is this a statistical anomaly or is there another statistical explanation?  http://www.planecrashinfo.com/famous.htm 

There seems to be quite a bit of evidence to suggest that the number of famous people who die in small plane crashes seems to be a bit higher than average. Most of you should be able to name a few off of the top of your head. 

I've tried coming up with a few explanations, but I lack the statistical ability to really explain it:

- These crashes are common, but because these people are famous they stick out like sore thumbs
- The people who fly in private jets are typically famous people, so when a private plane crashes there is a higher probability that one of the passengers will be famous (although this is interesting because there are far more private jets that transport corporate people like my dad and myself and their crash rate is significantly lower, so there are a few problems with this explanation)
- The number of times famous people use private jets per year is statistically higher than the average user of private jets, increasing their likelihood of dying in a plane crash. 

Now for some of the non statistical potential explanations:

- The quality of pilots for these famous people is lower

- The pilots are forced to fly through worse weather conditions that the average private jet would be required to so that these famous people can keep their schedule (assuming of course that they force the pilots to fly through worse conditions more than a corporate person would)

- The safety rules on these planes are more lax (electronics use, seat belt use, partying, etc...) which can lead to destabilization of the plane when absolute control is necessary (I don't know enough about avionics to determine if this could actually have an effect, but a bunch of rock stars partying with strippers in the back of a small plane must have some impact on the pilot's ability to fly the plane). 

Anyway, I'm just an engineering student with very little statistics background. 

Any light or explanations you guys could shed on this would be awesome. Thanks!

"Mapping functions to reduce Time Complexity? PhD Qual Item 

This was on my last comp stat qual. I gave an answer I thought was pretty good. We just get our score on the exam, not whether we got specific questions right. Hoping the community can give guidance on this one, I am not interested in the answer so much as what is being tested and where I can go read more about it and get some practice before the next exam.

At first glance it looks like a time complexity question, but when it starts talking about mapping-functions and pre-sorting data, I am not sure how to handle. So how would you answer?

Here it is:

    Given a set of items X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} drawn from some domain Z, your task is to find if a query item q in Z occurs in the set. For simplicity you may assume each item occurs exactly once in X and that it takes O(l) amount of time to compare any two items in Z.

    (a) Write pseudo-code for an algorithm which checks if q in X. What is the worst case time complexity of your algorithm?

    (b) If l is very large (e.g. if each element of X is a long video) then one needs efficient algorithms to check if q \in X. Suppose you are given access to k functions h_i: Z -&gt; {1, 2, ..., m} which uniformly map an element of Z to a number between 1 and m, and let k &lt;&lt; l and m &gt; n. Write pseudo-code for an algorithm which uses the function h_1...h_k to check if q \in X. Note that you are allowed to preprocess the data. What is the worst case time complexity of your algorithm?

    Be explicit about the inputs, outputs, and assumptions in your pseudocode.

"[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Catelyn and Cersei's fate in the books.   

I have watched the show sporadically, though I did experience the whole mess season 8 was, but I have read all five of the books and there are two things I'm really wondering about.

The first one is about Catelyn. I disliked her on the show but for some reason I really liked her in the books. I mean maybe some of it was because I had sympathy for her knowing that the red wedding is coming (spoiled before reading check) but I felt respect for her in a way. I mean she was really intelligent, at least compared to Robb who, at least at the books, seemed so annoying to me. He was really arrogant, thankfully not in Joffrey way, but Catelyn was way smarter and seemed to know better about politics and stuff but NOONE would listen to her. So yeah, I just see that she gets a lot of hate while Robb doesn't as much and I think the opposite would make more sense.

Now about Cersei, I find her to be very interesting even though she is nuts and insane, probably BECAUSE she is all that and I think that she get more credit for being an idiot than she deserves about all the decisions she makes when she gets a POV and because of her arrogance, but at the point she gets a POV she is already so messed up with all that has happened. At least through other POVS in the first books she seemed smarter. I just think that her arrogance and obsessions blind her (don't get me wrong, I hate her as much as everyone else) but that's not what I wanted to say at all. I'm just really wondering what do you think is gonna happen with her in the next book (if it ever gets published). It seems like there's a plan for her, but I really don't understand what. I don't think they'll follow the show on this.

"Is it possible for a model to increase overfitting when seeing new training examples for the first time? [D] So I was running a CNN over a large image dataset (94k images) and I was concerned about overfitting, so I implemented early stopping. But if I set 1 epoch to be all the training data, I found it overfit a lot before early stopping had a chance to stop it. So I reduced the epoch steps to about 10k so it would check after each time. I found that even after 3 epochs, the early stopping trigger when it measured that the validation MSE was increasing(even with a patience of 2 epochs).

But 3 epochs is only 30k samples, so the model hasn't even seen all the data points.  It's being given new data points and some how the validation MSE is increasing, even as the training MSE is decreasing. 

If I were training over the same training data many times, I understand why the model would overfit, but I don't see how giving it new training examples is reducing its ability to generalize. My guess is one of two things is happening:

1. The model overfitting isn't increasing, and it just got lucky on the first run somehow. 

2. The model is overfitting due to some other purposes.

"[SPOILERS] A game of thrones videogame idea There needs to be a game of thrones videogame. Yes, I know about the shitty RPG, the Telltale game, and Skyrim. The RPG (as mentioned) was shit. The Telltale game looks cool but isn't what I want. Skyrim is a wonderful game but I'd like to have a game in the actual universe of ASOIAF. You know with Targaryens, House Stark, all the important locations like Winterfell and Kings Landing. Also with White Walkers, Wargs, and all the different races and creatures of the series/universe.

I'd instantly fall in love with a new RPG for the next generation of consoles and PC. With nice graphics and all. Open World with all the major locations. Well, a map with every location from the game of thrones series would be huge, maybe first the north and then each kingdom as a later DLC, I don't know. You have a preset protagonist but can change almost everything about the protagonist such as clothes hairstyle etc. You have quests (main and sidequests) but you do not know which quest is a main or a sidequest. Similar to Skyrim or RDR2 there are people around the map giving you random quests. Maybe you can even build your own army and attack castles (that feature would be huge but, I use that word rarely, \*epic\*). You can learn abilities like warging into animals. Maybe you could even become a white walker and do missions for them. What about owning a dragon? Just imagine going mad and destroying Kings Landing with a dragon, just like Daenerys did (btw that scene in the show made no sense but seems fun in a videogame, call me mad). Also, it would be nice if there was destruction such as buildings getting destroyed if you burn them down with a dragon.

I know such a game will never happen but let me dream. I believe there will be GOT games especially since HBO is beginning to milk the franchise with new shows. It will still take years just like the Harry Potter franchise is just getting a big RPG next year (A whole decade after the last movie).  

Have a great day!",game of thrones

"[R] Introducing the CodeSearchNet challenge ""Searching for code to reuse, call into, or to see how others handle a problem is one of the most common tasks in a software developer’s day. However, search engines for code are often frustrating and never fully understand what we want, unlike regular web search engines. We started using modern machine learning techniques to improve code search but quickly realized that we were unable to measure our progress. Unlike natural language processing with GLUE benchmarks, there is no standard dataset suitable for code search evaluation.

With our partners from Weights &amp; Biases, today we’re announcing the CodeSearchNet Challenge evaluation environment and leaderboard. We’re also releasing a large dataset to help data scientists build models for this task, as well as several baseline models showing the current state of the art. Our leaderboard uses an annotated dataset of queries to evaluate the quality of code search tools.""

"[Spoilers] question about season 7 episode 6 This is my first time through the show, so please don’t spoil anything that is upcoming. 


So earlier on in the series, when bran asks uncle Benji to come with them across the wall and to winterfell, his uncle tells him of spells in place to keep the dead outside the wall, and since he had been partially turned, he was prevented from crossing. Then, in season 7 ep 6, when they all fly on the dragon across the wall, they brought the hostage zombie with them. I thought the spells kept the zombies from being able to cross the wall, at least to my knowledge at this point in the series. IF something about this is mentioned later on in the series, just tell me, but don’t tell me what it is. My only thought was that the spell didn’t apply if you fly over the wall, only for those attempting to go through the tunnel, but that seems lame. It would do nothing to prevent the undead from climbing over. Either that or this is a continuity error in the show.

"Comment Well, I’ve been on this subreddit for three days, so I haven’t seen explanation after explanation. I complained here because literally the only thing this post was asking was what was wrong with season 8. It sounds like you’re confident that you are objectively correct and people with differing views of the show are just misinformed or stubborn, so there’s probably no particular point to this.

And yet I’m here, so why not. It’s two things about Jaime for me. Big picture, I mostly agree with you. He kept telling himself and everyone else he was doing what he was doing for Cersei, and in the end, that was the case. But at the same time, he grew. He gained a much greater understanding of the world, he learned how to have personal relationships and care about people, and in losing his hand he had an identity crisis and had to reestablish his sense of self worth. His act of defiance in going North to fight was impressive and felt in-keeping with how things had been going.

And then he just returns. He chooses to be with Cersei and die with Cersei. If you don’t want to call that his arc being undone, it feels like semantics, because it sounds like we’re both seeing that in the end, he winds up exactly where he started. None of his experiences ended up changing his mind. It’s just lame, to me. If you’re satisfied with that, more power to you, but I’m not. 

The other thing is just him sleeping with Brienne. That felt wildly out of character for any version of Jaime and especially the one who, up to that point, cared a great deal about Brienne. In the larger context of the show, it felt to me like the showrunners teasing that he and Brienne might actually be together (which is weird because they were pretty clearly never going to be together), and then having him run away just to dash our hopes and see, “oh darn Jaime actually is still a villain.” It seemed sloppily manipulative and fell flat. That was a good chunk of the “ruin” for me.

It could’ve been fun to see him kill Cersei, though I never expected that to really happen. It seemed likely he’d die, and there were other characters set up to be more heroic so I wasn’t expecting some grand exit for him. I just would’ve really preferred that he’d died without consciously shaking off his experiences of the past seven seasons.",game of thrones
"When is it good practice to create ggproto objects for ggplot2? Hi,

I'm currently developing a package which makes use of ggplot2, where the function takes in a distance matrix and a dataframe of coordinates, and plots the former onto the latter as a ggplot. 

In doing this however, originally my thinking was to simply let the function return the result of my ggplot, and if the user wishes, s/he may add additional layers to this returned ggplot object with ""+"". Upon reading further on ggplot2 however, I now know that there is an additional ggproto available that allows one to create his or her own ggplot extensions. What I am having trouble understanding is in what cases doing this would be a good idea, since it seems that my function which returns a ggplot object would allow for further layering as well.

(Also disclaimer, I too didn’t like Sansa at all at first but she grew on me and now she’s a favourite of mine.) So much of the hate she gets is baseless, especially this:

A lot of people say they dislike her because she ‘betrayed’ her family, when she had to write a letter  to Robb asking to surrender, even though it was obviously not her words to Robb and Maester Luwin. It even comes up in season seven when the show writers tried to make us think Arya and Sansa would kill each other. 
I never understood why this was such a big issue.  Basically I feel like this reason for hating her is kinda baseless and unfair.

My question is how to rank/weight the words based on their position i.e. those at the beginning of the transaction description (removing any leading stop words/punctuation) would be given higher/greater significance than the words at the end of the transaction description (e.g. which are usually a location)?  I'd strip off each word (or n-gram) and place it into separate features  I.e.  FEATURE1=1st word/n-gram, FEATURE2=2nd word/n-gram, etc.  The first feature would have a higher fixed weight/importance than the weight of the second feature, and so on.

Any assistance would be most appreciated!",data science

"Difficulty understanding paired vs unpaired. If paired, how would I run a WIlcoxon Signed Rank Test different sizes? I apologize but I actually have TWO questions. I hope that it’s allowed.

Scenario: There are 5 ads running on Google (advertising the same product) in July and there are 6 ads (all of which are advertising the same product but different target audience) running in August. The way this is shown in a dataset is that EACH ad has a line PER DAY with the number of conversions associated (like, clicking on a website button that implies the consumer is interested). 

Q1. Would it be correct to compare July data as a whole to August data or should I further segment them?

Q2. If I did compare by month, would these be paired or unpaired? My thoughts would be that these are paired since they are continuous and that they are both advertising on Google. But maybe I’m thinking incorrectly. If these are unpaired (because 1 month contains 5 ads while the other contains 2), then would it be correct to say that if I compared identical advertisements by month are paired?

"Comment This isn’t Lord of the Rings. Barristan is a great warrior but he wouldn’t be able to go 1v5 against the rest of the Kingsguard, and that doesn’t take into account the City Watch which outnumbered the Stark men too. The coup would have still failed.

If the coup had succeeded, Tywin would have no choice but to start a war and there would be a war between Stannis and the Lannisters. The North would probably be compelled to join in the fighting as the perpetrators of the coup, meaning war in the Riverlands would probably still happen.

Shireen wouldn’t be betrothed to Rickon - he’s the third son and moreover, Ned has already shown his support of Stannis and there would be no need to secure an alliance. More likely Shireen would be betrothed to Sweetrobin to secure the Vale.

Stannis’s realm would not be peaceful either. Stannis is a hard ruler and wouldn’t be loved much of the smallfolk. Renly would still want the throne as he did in the series and he would still have the Tyrell army backing him - only this time, Stannis would be pre-occupied with war against the Lannisters.

The point of the story is that war between the houses is kind of inevitable. Multiple factions are working to destabilise the realm for various reasons and any potential cause would start a war between most of the kingdoms.

"[Spoilers] Alternate Ending? This has been discussed to death, but the biggest part of the finale of the show that disappointed me-- as it did for most viewers-- was how Dany's character arc was completely destroyed. She had been born into a family of madness, but she had managed to rise above her nature and become an icon of freedom and change.

 Instead of having Dany destroy the town when she heard the bells, wouldn't it have been great if she had had that moment of fury, hesitation, seething vengefulness...and fought against it? There could have even been the same lead-up with all of the other characters mentioning the meaning of the bells, so the viewer expects (and dreads) that Dany will hear them and ignore them. Then, when the time comes, there's that moment where you can tell she's considering doing the worst that she can to the city, and you're seriously not sure which option she'll choose. Then she backs down. The city is spared. 

I think it could have lead up to a great realization on her behalf; that she has the power and drive to become queen, but she also has a rage within her that must be tempered. Perhaps she could have ruled alongside someone who would have helped to calm the violent tendencies that came to her head. It would have been an excellent recognition of strength and weakness, and how we must depend on one another to bring out our best side while helping us handle ourselves at our worst.

They nearly got a crown when the wearer held back pre-battle information from her brother and his staff and expected to arrive in the nick of time to save the day, hopefully save their lives, and be acclaimed queen.  But then that booted little bitch Lyanna Mormont opened her at mouth.  Then the shoes' giver, slipper-y Lord Baelish, almost got her to take the throne but that didn't work out either.

"[SPOILERS] I just watched Season 8, even though I’m not a fan of the series and have only watched Seasons 1-3 and a little bit of 4. Overall, I enjoyed a fair amount of the season. I loved the moment where Jon confronted the Night King and my heart was beating really fast even though I not only knew what was going to happen (Arya’s dumb moment with the Night King), but I wasn’t invested in the series. 

However, I agree with most of the criticisms levelled at the season. So much of it felt rushed and the stuff that felt okay was either contrived, nonsensical, contradictory or occasionally interesting. 

Idk as someone who isn’t a fan of the show, I think there are elements of this that provide a somewhat satisfying conclusion, however so many of those elements aren’t executed well. 

I don’t think it’s as bad of a conclusion as Supernatural’s finale episode (the final season was great but the finale sucked) but yeah for fans of the series who were hoping for a nuanced and satisfying ending, I can see why this just wasn’t that.",game of thrones

"modeling cyclical time series processes Hello,

I am interested in creating graphs of stochastic processes with either python or R, but not really sure how. The resources I'm finding appear to be using pre-existing datasets to construct the time series graphs. I want to do it with functions. 

e.g., 

Yt=a\*cos(t)+b\*sin(t), t =1 ,..., T,

where a and b are two uncorrelated random variables with mean zero and common variance. 

Yes, this particular process is from a problem set, but the question is not to create a graph, I just think it would be useful to see what these processes look like.

"[SPOILERS] Why would Illyn Payne and the Kingsguard disobey Cersei Lannister? The execution of Ned Stark is considered a big mistake by pretty much everyone in the show. If you think about it, what is bizarre is that it was carried out at all. I mean, sure, it was technically ordered by King Joffrey, but it was a last-minute decision that was clearly not supported by Queen Cersei.

At the time, Joffrey was a boy-king whose power completely relied on his maternal family. His paternal uncles considered him a bastard and sought to overthrow him. Say you were in Illyn Payne's shoes against this backdrop and Joffrey gives you some irrevocable order (such as killing Ned Stark), wouldn't you make sure this was approved by Queen Cersei as well?

I mean, it would have been understandable if Ilyn Payne wanted to refrain from being seen openly defying a direct order from his king, but there was a pretty chaotic situation and it seemed as though he could have given the small council members (who were all visibly shocked) a little more time to plead with Joffrey instead of acting like a mindless robot.

Another bizarre thing is that neither Illyn Payne nor any of the Kingsguard were ever punished by Queen Cersei or Tywin Lannister (who are otherwise very vengeful people) for their stupidity later on.",game of thrones

"Comment I don't believe in this whole un-rush thing. What show could have done is:

1. **Remove inconsistencies.** For example, in S7 Dany says Viserys was a fool to believe people will call unto him. But then in S8 she got astonished that people didn't love her. What is audience to get out of it? That Dany was an unreliable narrator? This is not the books where we know character's thought process. Another example, Tyrion supports the idea of sieging the city but then doesn't understand that people die in war? Again, what is audience to get out of this? Further, Randyll is supporting Cersei despite her killing his vassal house? What?! Is the show telling me that his xenophobia trumped kin-slaying too?
2. **Dialogues, dialogues and dialogues**! Just compare the dialogues from earlier seasons and see the stark difference.
3. **Don't make characters dumb just for the sake of it:** Why did LF sell Sansa to the guy he knew nothing about? Varys just plotting in Dany's own home instead of working at a distance? What? Tyrion not understanding that war kills people? Claiming that Dany shouldn't send dragons? Was he dumb to think that she'd unleash her dragons or just clairvoyant? Jon Snow couldn't bother lying to Cersei?? The battle strategies in The Long Night?! Were we watching dumb characters all this time? 
4. **Don't stop writing character arcs and world building just because story is coming to a conclusion:** Otherwise it feels very bland.
5. **More consequences please:** Cersei burns down sept, kills House Tyrell but somehow reach lords are fine with it?

People claiming that character arcs of Jaime and Dany were ruined don't understand nuances. They only seem to understand very surface level criticisms. That should change, it's been 2+ years. Writers aren't beholden to follow arcs you want them to.

I was looking specifically at Business Analytics for a masters degree because it doesn’t initially require the intense mathematics background that I don’t have, and gives an opportunity to learn it as you take classes (hopefully). After reading through some subreddits, though, people make it seem like a masters in business analytics is completely useless and you won’t be able to get a DS job with it. I’ve even seen people claiming to be hiring managers say that they don’t take the degrees seriously which is worrying. I guess my question is, should I really not even try? I don’t want to waste my time or money on getting the degree if it isn’t taken seriously/won’t get me a DS-related job, so any honest feedback would be helpful!

However, it's just so depressing to me to see him get exiled after everything he's been through.

"[SPOILERS] Conspiracy, Night King wasn't a villain Guys I have been pondering over this theory for a long time, and would love to know what you think on it. Also, it's just ""a theory"" so no need to get offended...   
So I've been wondering if the Night king was actually the Victim in this show. Now I haven't read all the  other sidebooks of ASOIAF, but I did read a lot of wiki articles... so I may be short a few facts.. but just listen me out.   
So What if the NK, wasn't all bad. I mean.. think of it this way... He was forced to become a monster, using the magic of the Children. The children are never really explained to us, nor their ways. He was supposed to help the Children fight the First men, But instead, went rogue, causing the children and The First Men unite against the bigger enemy. Now, maybe the NK is all conscious. He must have lost all his family, and closed ones, and he thought, with the power to bring them all back, it would have been better for him and them. Though the walkers don't speak, they do have a way to communicate with each other. He wanted revenge upon those who made him that way.   
About the 3-eyed Raven, we don't know much, Just that the one Bran met was a bastard targaryen and they had the ability to warg into other animals, and see the things that were, things that are, and things that have not yet come to pass... And that Bran changed totally on becoming the raven. What if it isn't a power or a knowledge, but the leader of the children(the children did serve the 3 eyed raven and gave their lives to protect him) who found out a way to be immortal, by possessing the body of another person, though to keep his foresight, the person should have been a warg, who let him in of his own will(though not consciously). So he kept an eye on the best of wargs, (Bran was the only one who could warg into another Human(Hodor). When Meera said to Bran that he died in the cave, she meant it. Maybe Bran's soul is dead and his body is possessed by the Raven's spirit or maybe Bran's soul in trapped somewhere in hsi own body, while the Raven is dominating over it. There was a lot of ways for the final season to occur, but Bran did just the thing he wanted in just the way he wanted, to make himself King.   
Bran was already home at winterfell before Jon's expedition north to capture the Wight. He could easily have warned Dany and Jon to beware and control her dragons since the NK's gonna kill it. He could have just as well warned about Rhaegal being killed by Euron's ships but he didn't. I mean, even if he couldn't see the future(which he can since he said ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" as he knew that he was gonna be made king so he couldn't be lord of anything) he would have atleast known that the scorpions were made and loaded on the ships.... but he didn't do anything to warn them. He let Missandei die and Dany go mad. Also before, HE could have informed Jon of his parentage just when he reached Winterfell. But he chose not to. He told Sam ""it's time"" cuz he knew informing Dany when he did, would put a major strain in their relation. Hence Jon killing Dany in the end and Bran crowned King. Now he says he cannot sire children, which wasn't confirmed by even a single Maester. All that was confirmed was that he cannot walk. I do understand that being crippled that way might make one lose the ability to procreate but no one said he couldn't. Of course when he was treated by the maesters, he was too young to be checked properly, he could have been checked later. But over the years of planning, the only way which the Ravens though possible for himself to be crowned king was this way, and also having the support of all houses. He will most probably pick up another warg and transform him to become another host for the Raven's spirit ""cuz who has a better story than the Raven"".
NK wanted to kill the Raven because he knew of this plan of his. He predicted how many people would die because of it, and he wanted to stop it. Over time, he realized that men are mortal and that if he transformed them they would live forever. So with a heavy heart and a positive mission, he attacked all the Men, with the hope that he'd raise them again and they wont be dead. But he would kill the Raven himself, with his sword/spear to his heart, just like he was tortured with a shard of dragonglass to the heart. Yes his means were wrong but his intent was totally understandable and acceptable.

"Analyze Facebook Messenger Data with Python and Pandas  

**Hey, Reddit!** Who would like to have a magic wand to go back in the past and find lots of fun facts in our friend’s conversations? Thanks to the law on private data, we can access all our previous conversations on Facebook, and **who says data, says Python and graphs!**

This dive into my messenger conversations comes from one question: **What the heck is going on in the group conversation with my friends?** There are websites where you can print your whole **conversation on books**, and share it with your friends. First of all, I don’t want all the photos from this discussion to be spread around the world. Second, This would be a way too huge book for me to read, **we have around 50k messages spread on mostly 10y of Facebook experience in this single thread**. This is why I wanted to do what I know how to do: Run some analyses on the data we have at hand. This will be my **late Christmas gift** to them. *Some fun on a chocolate bar* as we say here.

## We will first see :

1. **How to get our messages back and understand how to read it**
2. **What we can dig into it and focus on a specific question**
3. **Try to put it all together and look at those beautiful results**

"Help understanding this dice loss function Im doing image segmentation, and have  achieved good results using dice as metric and 1-dice as a loss  function. Recently I found this loss function that extracts the original  border and then uses that to compare with the prediction.

    def dice_coef_border(y_true, y_pred):     
        border = get_border_mask((21, 21), y_true)      
        border = K.flatten(border)     
        y_true_f = K.flatten(y_true)     
        y_pred_f = K.flatten(y_pred)     
        y_true_f = K.tf.gather(y_true_f, K.tf.where(border &gt; 0.5))     
        y_pred_f = K.tf.gather(y_pred_f, K.tf.where(border &gt; 0.5))      
        return dice_coef(y_true_f, y_pred_f)  
    
    def get_border_mask(pool_size, y_true):     
        negative = 1 - y_true     
        positive = y_true     
        positive = K.pool2d(positive, pool_size=pool_size, padding=""same"")     
        negative = K.pool2d(negative, pool_size=pool_size, padding=""same"")     
        border = positive * negative     
        return border 

I don't quite understand how  it uses max pooling to get the border, and why it uses such a big  stride. As I understand it this would give some results close to the  border incorrectly labeled as border, and this border it returns would  have a reduced dimentionality.

&amp;#x200B;

Shouldn't it be imposible to compare the result of the pooling with the predicted mask as the pooling will reduce the original dimensions.

&amp;#x200B;

Also  on the dice\_coef\_border I don't understand why it only targets elements  with over 0.5 value? is this just a random threshold.

"Time Series Analysis: GAM or Loess Smoothing? [https://imgur.com/a/F1Op17S](https://imgur.com/a/F1Op17S)

&amp;#x200B;

That is the Time Series that I am analyzing. Just the first run of some biochem related time process. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering how do I know what kind of trend to pick for the data? In a class I did a while ago we just chose a loess and picked a span we wanted and fitted ARMA models to the residuals. It was just an intro time series class. The math was very watered down and so I don't know too much theory-wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

But how would I know rigorously the span to pick for loess?

 I have also been reading about GAMs on my own, though I understand very little. I know how to use gam() in the mgcv package but what it is actually doing mathematically I have no idea. I just mess around with the k value until the p-value is &gt;0.05 in gam.check() but in reality no idea what all this even means other than that you don't want too low k. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the span you pick and the model you use to pick the trend seems to affect the ACF and PACF plots and the subsequent ARMA models. How am I supposed to pick something that will be representative of other Trials of the same experiment for comparisons? Cross validation/GCV is not valid for Time Series Data in the usual sense, which is something I remember I asked the prof when I took the class but he said the reasons are complicated.

I still can't get over the last season. Game of Thrones has been my favorite show of all time. Despite the final season, I still loved the last seven of them.

I was just wondering, does rewatching the show from the beginning till the end make the last season better? I keep thinking that maybe the reason why it sucked for me was because they made us wait two years before releasing the eight season. I didn't watch the season 7 for the second time before diving into season 8. So basically, everything that happened in the seventh season was kind of a blur while I was watching the eight one.

Does that make sense? Maybe I just find season 8 to be a bad season only because it didn't feel connected to the seventh season. Or is it really a shitty season?

Obviously it was meant to mirror Lyanna Stark and Robert Baratheon. But does anyone else think it was a huge change in character for Gendry to propose to Arya like that? I mean sure the lad is running high on the adrenaline of the Battle of Winterfell and having just been made a Lord, but he knows better than anyone that Arya didn't want to be a lady, and him proposing just seemed way off from how I imagine he would have reacted.

Personally I would have kept the scene similar, but mirrored their conversation at Hollow Hill, the infamous ""I can be your family"" line. It would have been a wonderful callback and I think maybe Arya would have responded better to that than ""marry me"". Obviously there is still the issue of Arya not wanting to be tied down, but it removes the presumptive air that Gendry is going to try to make Arya behave like a typical Lady. I wouldn't even mind if she still said no, like he did to her, but I feel like it would have been far more bittersweet and fitting for both characters if it had gone this way.

"[Q] Guidance on design for specific survey analysis Cross posted on r/AskStatistics \- not sure if that is allowed. If not, can delete.

I'll try (and fail) to keep this brief. I am looking to get some feedback on the following potential research design idea to answer the following RQ:

**RQ: How does** ***perceived individual teacher value*** **and** ***perceived leadership support*** **of teacher professional development** ***differ*** **in how they influence perceived change in teacher instructional improvement from the start to the end of the school year?**

Essentially, I want to use a repeated fall and spring teacher survey measure on their perceptions of teacher professional development (PD) over the school year to help determine how their perceived value of it and their perception of leadership value of the PD influence how they feel they USE the PD to improve their classroom instruction.

**IV#1 - The teacher’s own individual perceived value of the PD (I believe there are FIVE survey questions that will be associated with this one factor).**

**IV#2 - The teacher’s perception of how school leadership value’s the PD (I believe there are TWO questions that will be associated with this one factor).**

Ultimately, I want to see how these two IV’s differ in influencing the following DV:

**DV#1 - The perceived change in teachers own instructional improvement (I believe there are FOUR questions that will be associated with this one factor)**

Doing this analysis, will be a first step in helping to qualitatively investigate how leadership's value of PD and its delivery influences how teacher's use it in the classroom. The qual part will be focused on teacher and admin interviews and so on, and the analysis results will help shape those interview questions.

SO – My big questions regarding the IV / DV analysis process are:

* Can I do an exploratory factor analysis and take those factor scores to then see how those two IV’s relate to the DV? Is this just a waste of time? (This survey scale was put together by somebody else, based on some other teacher PD literature, and never been validated, so no CFA, right?)
* I believe if I looked at the correlation of the IVs with the DV separately, I could do something like two Spearman’s Correlation (Spearman because the IV’s are ordinal) analyses. BUT, if I wanted to compare the two IVs and how their influence differs (which is what I want to do), would a two-way repeated measures ANOVA work? The DV is ordinal…my understanding is that the DV should be continuous for this, but I've seen where researchers use ordinal anyways? Or could it be converted? The DV questions (4) are all multiple choice 4-pt Likert scale questions.
* I would also like to see what those IV to DV influences look like by individual school. My survey data is broken down by individual school (multiple involved in study) Possible? This would really inform our work.
* Possible to look at how those influences changed over time from fall to spring of this school year? Worthwhile?

    # row = a row from a dataframe which has been split
    # row_n = the row's number

    grey_idxs &lt;- which(is.na(row))

    # Ideally I want to do this:
    map(grey_idxs, apply_styles, 'sheet1', style=grey_out, rows=row_n, gridExpand=FALSE) 
    }

My problem is that if I add default arguments to the apply_styles function, the header/body lists that are passed will no longer work.

So I am wondering if there is a way I can unlist the style_map lists so that they overwrite any default arguments where applicable. unlist() itself does not seem to promising as it is expanding the cols element into $header.cols1, $header.cols2, etc.

Creating a list and then filling its cols element with the grey_idxs will probably work but I feel that it is less readable and elsewhere I would like to be able to make gridExpand TRUE by default since most of my style mappings use it.

"[Spoilers] Re-Watching GoT I came to the ""Hodor Scene"" ... and after five years I still cringe about how stupid that scene is.

It's so hokey. It's so badly acted. It's even badly filmed because Meera made it all of what, fifty feet because of Hodors sacrifice? The scene is taking a second rate joke and trying to turn it into an emotional key moment. It mistakes Hodors dependency on others for loyalty, Brans domination of his mind for love and marks the series' trend of selling contrivances as clever twists. 

Absolutely was one of the moments where I saw the series with new eyes and started seriously doubting where they were going with this. Am I missing something here? Is this supposed to be tragic and I don't see it? Does Bran ever get any kind of comeupance or at least gets chewed out for basically mind-raping a little boy into dying for him? This whole plotline for me is coloured by the ending, so that might be part of an explanation.

But I'd honestly be curious how others see it now. I remember that scene being powerful for some viewers, because we've known Hodor for so long at that point. Do you think it holds up?",game of thrones

"Using gradient descent to find minima in a dataset instead of its cost function? Hello fellow ML-loving redditors,

I am working on a project for a class and was stumped by the directions provided to me. The gist of it is, we have a dataset that is essentially a 3D gaussian distribution. We have to implement a gradient descent algorithm (simple enough)-but the catch is that we have to implement it for the dataset and find all local minima in the z-axis, rather than just minimizing the cost function (although we also have to do this).

I have used gradient descent algorithms in the past but I'm baffled by this. I've never used GD to find the minima within a dataset, at least as far as I can recall. How does one approach this problem?

My personal approach, at least on a first try, would simply be to check each point against its immediate neighbors and determine if it has a lower z value. However, we've received confirmation from our instructor that, yes, we have to find the x and y coordinates of the local minima using gradient descent specifically. I'm not sure where to begin, does anyone know what the overall procedure is? I'm happy to provide more details if asked.",data science

"[SPOILERS] Which characters did you get the hots for despite your best efforts not to? Just a fun thought this morning. With as deep and complex as this show is, I know I can’t be the only one to get shamefully all in my feelings over some of the characters. 

Jaime Lannister, that inbreeding, attempted child-murdering turd, really stole my heart through seasons 2 and 3. He’s so damn arrogant but it’s like Brienne tamed him and you see he just needed to be around people outside of his crazy ass family. He’s really sweet when he wants to be. I can’t believe now I used to hate him. I’m not even that bothered he shoved Bran out of a tower anymore.

I am ashamed to admit this considering he’s far old enough to be my father but Stannis is hot. There. I said it. In Westeros it wouldn’t even be that weird.

Bronn’s another one I just…he’s low key scuzzy but not in the worst way. He’s charismatic enough to outweigh that. 

I was also straight up in love with Robb the first time I watched the show as a teen but now, all of 5 years later, his father is my one true love. Go figure.

"[SPOILERS] Just rewatched the whole series again, including Season 8… I’m ready for the downvotes. Here we go.

I fucking loved Season 8. No joke.

When I first saw it, I was kind of mixed, but definitely more positive about it than other people. Rewatching it made me appreciate it even more. I think what helped was already knowing how it would end and not thinking of all the theories that could happen.

Daenerys’ fall was very believable to me. People don’t really realize this, but she wasn’t afraid to spill blood during her time in Essos, even those who aren’t completely evil. But with the love of all the people there, her worst impulses were checked. Seeing her come to Westeros, losing more than winning, seeing the people there flat out reject her, finding out the man she loves is the biggest threat to her claim (a throne she full heartedly belonged to her since Viserys died) definitely hit her ego hard. It wasn’t all easy obviously, but when she was in Essos towards the later seasons, she was winning like MJ in the 90’s. The biggest hits to her were when she lost her dragons and Missandei, her best friend. Yeah, no shit she’d want to kill everyone and start a new world full of people who loved her. In the end, she was the worst villain in the show’s history. Gave me big Thanos Endgame vibes.

Jon’s story was perfect, especially the ending. Game of Thrones is all about putting down the mythical hero legend in favor of realistic expectations. Jon being a noble, good hearted, humble guy who finds out he’s the heir to the throne? Sure it would work in other stories, but not here. And if he did sit on the throne, he’d be unhappy. He got his happy ending by going back to the North up with Tormund and Ghost. He gets to be free and live his life. Yes I know his sentence was to be a part of the Nights Watch, but with the Unsullied leaving and his family being the most powerful people in Westeros, I don’t think anyone would give a shit if he decided to live among the Wildlings.

Sansa was badass. I didn’t like her story the first time I saw it but now that I saw the series again, I really did buy into her growth. She goes from an innocent little girl to an intelligent, savvy political operator, while still keeping her good heart and loyalty. It’s these characters that are the heroes of Game of Thrones. The smart ones who are willing to do what it takes to win for the people, not because of some lofty ideal or their personal ambition.

Arya’s story was alright early in the show but I did definitely appreciated that she killed the Night King. It would’ve been a waste to have her train for years without actually doing something big.

Now on the Night King and how the White Walkers died in one episode. I don’t think the point of the show was to have the White Walkers wage a full out war with the living for an entire season, it’s how this world ending crisis would kill everyone unless they put their petty differences aside. And for the most part, they did. The Night King’s impact changed the course of the world forever. After all, he killed Daenerys’ dragon and gave Cersei the opportunity to press her forces while everyone else dealt with him, definitely putting Daenerys on the path to be a psychotic killer. The Long Night was a terrific episode. What changed my view on it was by not treating it like some epic battle like Helm’s Deep in LOTR, it was just purely surviving hell. The darkness helped with creating such a sense of dread and fear. It’s not about winning some big battle, it’s about realizing you have no chance fighting head on, and praying your Hail Mary would work.

Bran as king? Yes. Why wouldn’t we want someone who has his powers being the king? Forget the valiant heroes and idealists, they are terrible leaders (in real life too). We need the all knowing, non ambitious people. 

The cinematography and music was some of the greatest, not just in the show, but in all of TV and movies.

There were definitely some issues, but overall, I really really loved Season 8. I don’t care what anyone else says, I think it’s a terrific ending. Downvote me to hell.",game of thrones
"[D] Explain TFX Metadata Store data model definitions **Can you please:**

1.) Explain the following definitions in plane simple english?

2.) Many practical examples of what they can have?

3.) What each of them do?

This is the original [https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd#data\_model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/mlmd#data_model) ""The Metadata Store uses the following data model to record and retrieve metadata from the storage backend."":

* **ArtifactType**describes an artifact's type and its properties that are stored in the metadata store. You can register these types on-the-fly with the metadata store in code, or you can load them in the store from a serialized format. Once you register a type, its definition is available throughout the lifetime of the store.
* An **Artifact**describes a specific instance of an ArtifactType, and its properties that are written to the metadata store.
* An **ExecutionType**describes a type of component or step in a workflow, and its runtime parameters.
* An **Execution**is a record of a component run or a step in an ML workflow and the runtime parameters. An execution can be thought of as an instance of an ExecutionType. Executions are recorded when you run an ML pipeline or step.
* An **Event**is a record of the relationship between artifacts and executions. When an execution happens, events record every artifact that was used by the execution, and every artifact that was produced. These records allow for lineage tracking throughout a workflow. By looking at all events, MLMD knows what executions happened and what artifacts were created as a result. MLMD can then recurse back from any artifact to all of its upstream inputs.
* A **ContextType**describes a type of conceptual group of artifacts and executions in a workflow, and its structural properties. For example: projects, pipeline runs, experiments, owners etc.
* A **Context**is an instance of a ContextType. It captures the shared information within the group. For example: project name, changelist commit id, experiment annotations etc. It has a user-defined unique name within its ContextType.
* An **Attribution**is a record of the relationship between artifacts and contexts.
* An **Association**is a record of the relationship between executions and contexts.",data science

"Can an ordinal variable be converted into a ratio variable? Let's say that I want to use a t-test to create confidence intervals for the mean rating of horror movies on a movie website. I want to do this using the website's 5 star rating system.

Since the use of confidence intervals from a t-distribution relies on the assumption that the data is continuous rather than discrete/ordinal, I wouldn't be able to legitimately use the star ratings as data (e.g. the values of 1-5) since the data is discrete (""illegitimate"" in this case meaning they do not satisfy a required assumption). They have no decimal values and there's a limited range from 1 to 5.

However, is it possible to legitimately convert these ratings into decimals that way they can now be continuous? For instance, converting a 3 star rating into .60 since 3/5 = .60?

So instead of having the values:

The values are now:

We tried to train it with different features extracted from our dataset, SURF/HOG/LBP/color histogram or fusion thereof, and while the classifier has great performance on the validation set, on real images the Average Precision is around 0, as it finds a lot of false positives.

- The cards have high intra-class variance, and probably low inter-class variance since they roughly have the same characteristics/shape, can this be defined as a Fine-grained Image classification problem?

"[SPOILERS] My issue with the ending. It got contradictory and stupid near the end.

For eg. Ser barriston, who used to win against great warriors, died by the hands of street thugs. I get he was old but he was definitely shown as very capable in previous seasons and then he died so easily in a street fight.

Tyrion whose only weapon was his wits took so many stupid decisions, i get even the smartest people can take wrong decisions but it feels like he didn't just take wrong decisions, he became kinda supid than the previous season version of him which feels contradictory to me, they build him as smart then make him take stupid actions.

Spider died so awkwardly, i know its game of thrones and people die unexpectedly. But previous deaths like this made the show more intriguing (like red wedding, it was very unexpected but it didn't put me off, it just made me more engaged) but spider's death really felt like forced, it felt more like a production decision, (they didn't know what to do with the character so they killed him) than a plot point.

Dany becoming what she hated. I don't mind that dany became evil and killed thousands of innocents as much as i mind the speed of her transition, if they had taken it slowly and gradually made her evil, it would be totally acceptable but she became a devil from an angel in like 2-3 eps, and for no justifiable reason. In short i don't mind her becoming evil, it again felt like a production decision not a plot point and i hate that.

And many more like bran becoming the king(didn't he say he can't inherit anything?) John going back to wall(he is the actual heir!), Cercie was smarter than that! And so many more.

Tldr:
S7's and especially s8's plots felt like production decisions and not storyline. They rushed everything, if they had given us the exact same ending but in a span of 4-5 seasons taking it slowly and giving enough reasons for transitions of characters, i would have most probably liked it, just think about the transition of hound, from a loyal servant to rouge, no one minded that because it made sense as they gradually transitioned him, imagine if that had happened in a single ep, no one would like that as it would felt unrealistic. 

In super short: they rushed it.

"Is there a need for an open source experiment management tool? As a programming exercise, I started working on a small tool for managing experiment metadata which is similar to internal tools I've created in the past, and it struck me that I don't know of anything like it in the public domain.  

This is a ""CRUD App"" that allows self-service creation of experiments and setting up the treatment variants,  and various lifecycle actions like throttling/ramping up the number of users, ending the experiment, putting all users in a chosen variant, etc.  It defines a particular treatment assignment algorithm (pseudo-random hashing), although ideally it could accommodate more than one. 

For large-scale experimentation, we used a standalone app like this to let analysts manage their experiments, and  implemented a pusher that moved the current settings to production every minute, so that changes would be reflected in production within a 5-minute SLA.  Client code would assign each user to a treatment with this metadata, using attributes such as hash seed, number of variants, weights, and percentage in treatment.  

For any given production environment, it would take some glue code to implement the treatment assignment (perhaps 20 lines), and some kind of distribution layer (eg zookeeper, or we used to use just memcache TBH), but much of the drudgery of creating an internal framework to manage experiments would be alleviated, and there may be some benefits to using a single statistically-vetted treatment assignment algorithm (the dreaded ""is Experiment working?"" question).  

There are a number of proprietary tools that do this as a service, but I thought it might be good to have an on-prem solution available, and I'm not aware of any.  Does this seem useful?",data science

"Comment Many of the usual complaints. It felt rushed and many characters started acting in ways that felt forced and unnatural. I hated the anticlimax that was the Long Night, and how neatly it just tied off that entire side of the show. I hated how painfully obvious the plot armor was in that episode, where you can see named characters get swarmed by wights and then it just cuts away and they’re fine. I also hated how hard it is to see the vast majority of that battle.

I hated that they undid seven seasons worth of character development for Jaime. He was one of my favorite characters, and it felt like they kinda ruined him. I hate how much they dumbed down the most intelligent characters. I hate that Dany can’t see a fleet sailing in front of her. I felt like every enjoyable moment from the final season still felt contrived and as there to get the plot where they wanted. I didn’t mind Danny’s rampage but I don’t feel like they did the work to get her to that state of mind.

“Bran has the best story” feels almost like a direct insult to fans. He does not. I hate how they handled his apparent omniscience. I hate that the new prince of Dorne doesn’t also seek independence. I hate that Jon’s parentage ultimately means very little to the plot. I hate Euron’s eye-liner. I stopped caring about the Starks, I actually stopped caring about most of the characters. I hate how utterly useless Harry Strickland was.

I love some moments. Parts of the Long Night are impressive, Brienne getting knighted, any acknowledgement of Nymeria. Dany’s rampage is very difficult to watch in the best possible way, and the aftermath of that slaughter is striking. But the negatives so outweighed the positives that it didn’t matter much.

Edit: I see many people trotting out the idea that the only people upset were those that got their hopes up for certain outcomes. This was not a matter of expectations for me. I truly didn’t have a desired outcome for who lives, who dies and who sits on the throne. By the middle of season 7 I’d learned not to expect for characters to act rationally or for everything to make sense and I went into 8 only hoping for a satisfying resolution, whatever form it took.

"[Spoilers], Questions for fans of the last few seasons. I profess...I used to be a big fan of the series, and like many I too was greatly disappointed by the last few seasons...especially season 8, which to me just threw away a lot of character arcs (though I did like the last few seasons a lot more than many). But I do know that, when it comes to shows that have a lot of fans and if many are displeased. They can get together and form a collective ""Group Think"" where many are influenced by the opinions of the majority rather than actually taking the time to sit with it and judge for themselves whether they like it or not.  I experienced this with the ending of LOST. A show, like GOT that was heavily reviled by a large portion of it's fans for it's final few seasons, and especially it's ending  (though the reasoning is somewhat different. Many misunderstood it and viewed the whole series as a collective dream or purgatory, which wasn't true, it did explore purgatory but only with one storyline).  I was one of the fans that loved the ending and the journey leading to it. In recent years, the show is being looked at with fresh eyes and reevaluated. Now there is a lot of reaction videos with many adoring the majority of the show (one reactor called season 6 his favorite season).

My questions are. Do you see the same happening with GOT?:

* If you loved the ending (final few seasons). What did you like about it?.
* Do you think the final few seasons get unfairly criticized, if so, why?.
* Is there a character in particular that you loved their arc? (which get's criticized).

I'm merely seeking a thoughtful and creative discussion on the show. I thought, the best way to do that is to ask the fans who lived and breathed the world and fell in love with it's characters. **Full series spoilers are allowed.**",game of thrones

"Help understanding Moran's I Hi, this is for work, but if this question is more appropriate in a homework help sub, please let me know and I can move it. I am not a statistician but I think LISA is really cool, particularly because it can potentially identify anomalies in addition to hot/cold spot analysis.

I am actually using the new **Differential Moran's I** but it is really not that different from other versions. You give it columns of the same variable for two different time frames, it calculates the difference between the values of each time frame for each observation, and then runs a Univariate Moran's I based on the new difference variable.

I am reading [the glossary](https://geodacenter.github.io/glossary.html) for GeoDa because I haven't been able to find the depth I want in the old documentation. Also, the new ""documentation"" for the Differential Moran's I is incredibly lacking. 

It calculates a Z Score for 1) the observation (the core) and then 2) the neighbors. For the p-values, this is based on the number of random permutations. If the random permutations are greater than the observed value (the z score?) 8 times, that would be 8 / 1000 or a p-value of 0.001. **What are the values of the random permutations? Randomized Z Scores? What is the range of the Z Scores? Within the range of the entire data set provided?**

For deciding whether an observation is High-High, Low-Low, Low-High, and High-Low, you can take a look at the Moran's Scatter Plot. This has the Z Score of the observation and the Z Score of the average of the neighbors. Based on which quadrant it falls into, and whether or not it is statistically significant, you can tell which bin it belongs into. But the graph is just a visualization. **How do you determine which ""bin"" an observation belongs to without using the graph?**

Is there anything else that strikes out to you that I am missing to ask? I have not found documentation that answers these questions like this. I have attempted to read Anselin 1995 but wow, that was pretty difficult for a non statistician to parse. 

Thank you for any and all help, I really appreciate it.

"How to tune anchor boxes in SSD family of detectors for a specific dataset? I am trying to optimize an SSD-based object detector ([RFBNet](https://github.com/ruinmessi/RFBNet)) for a dataset, by tuning the anchor boxes and aspect ratios.

SSD implementations come with pre-defined configurations for standard datasets, like VOC, COCO. But, it is not clear how to tune the anchor boxes for a specific dataset to obtain the highest accuracy and highest speed (with less anchor boxes). I have read the original [SSD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325); it describes the anchor boxes and loss functions, but does not say anything about how to tune the anchors (just says in page 6: ""How to design the optimal tiling is an open question as well."").

These are the typical parameters in SSD implementations for 512x512 input images:

* feature\_maps : \[64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1\]
* steps : \[8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512\]
* box\_sizes : \[20.48, 51.2, 133.12, 215.04, 296.96, 378.88, 460.8\]
* aspect\_ratios : \[\[2, 3\], \[2, 3\], \[2, 3\], \[2, 3\], \[2, 3\], \[2\], \[2\]\]   (symmetric, 2 means 1/2 and 2; aspect ratio 1.0 is included by default)
* variance : \[0.1, 0.2\]

If we fix the input image size and the network, hence the feature map sizes; **how to best tune the steps, box\_sizes and aspect ratios?** For example, in pedestrian detection only, we will typically have aspect ratios less than 1.0; so, there is no need to include the other aspect ratios (reducing the number of output channels, and anchor boxes).

What I have been trying: plot the bounding boxes in the dataset, and set these parameters according to the typical bbox sizes and aspect ratios, but unable to obtain better accuracy (yet). It seems to be quite sensitive to these parameters. Moreover, the pre-trained base model (vgg16\_reducedfc.pth) is no more very helpful if we change the anchor boxes (normally, quite helpful, converges much faster).

**Follow-up question 1**: while generating the anchor boxes, the sqrt of anchor boxes is used (i.e., anchor\_boxes += \[cx, cy, s\_k\*sqrt(ar), s\_k/sqrt(ar)\]). Why?

**Follow-up question 2**: What are the variance parameters for and how are they set to \[0.1, 0.2\]? Are they dataset specific?

I think, these are crucial questions, which were not explained in the paper. I had a look at some blog posts, but they are basically the same as the paper; no new insight. Are they set experimentally?

SSD is one of the influential object detectors, with several derivative detectors (RefineDet, RFBNet, etc.) yet it is weird that such fundamental questions remain unanswered.

I hope, we can collectively clarify some or all of these issues here.",data science

I know they’re in the making of a prequel series but regarding the main series do you think that one day we might see a return to the beloved characters of ASOIAF and if so, what would you want to see?",game of thrones

"Comment It’s a great plan to rule the north if you don’t believe in the White Walkers. 
1. Sansa’s 1st born son would lay claim to Robb’s crown because by housing Sansa that is open rebellion against the crown.
2. The North is virtually untouched by the War of the 5 Kings except that a large part of the population has been culled by leaving with Robb (which was likely to happen during winter anyway and a previous Stark waged a war before winter for this very reason) so food store and infrastructure are intact.
3. Most lords died at the twins so Roose has about 20 years of Winter to rally the threat of the south to his cause with young impressionable lords and lady’s
4. The south during the most important autumn, spent all that time in constant civil war, killing and pillaging the small folk farmers to the point of famine before winter likely leading to mass starvation during winter while the least affected areas like Dorne have no reason to help the Crown survive Winter. 

Roose would have decades to prepare for eventual retaliation from the Crown once Winter was in full swing and would possibly be in a position to conquer the majority of the South depending on how the Winter played out….except he’d be zombie chow tho",game of thrones

"Noob question about covariance calculation For some reason I can't get cov(X,Y) by doing the formula I see from [class/wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance#Definition), which is cov(X,Y) = E(XY) - E(X)*E(Y)

I'm using the X and Y from this website, and their answer for cov(x,y) is about half way down and it's -8.07, which is what I get with the cov() command.
https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Covariance#Calculating_Covariance_by_Hand_with_the_Standard_Formula_sub

I go into R and I type:

    a &lt;- c(1,3,2,5,8,7,12,2,4)
    b &lt;- c(8,6,9,4,3,3,2,7,7)
    cov(a,b) #cov = -8.07
    #agrees with wikihow answer

    #now manually calculate:
    mean(a)
    #4.888 E(X)

    mean(b)
    #5.444 E(Y)

    z = a*b
    mean(z)
    #19.444 E(XY)

    E(XY) - E(X)*E(Y)
    19.44 - 4.888*5.444
    -7.17
    #disagrees with cov() function :( 

Any idea what I'm doing wrong with my manual calculation?",data science

"[R] StyleCLIP: Text-Driven Manipulation of StyleGAN Imagery - SOTA StyleGAN image editing [StyleCLIP: Text-Driven Manipulation of StyleGAN Imagery](https://t.me/casual_gan/18)

This idea is so elegant, yet powerful:  
The authors use the recent CLIP model in a loss function to train a mapping network that takes text descriptions of image edits (e.g. ""a man with long hair"", ""Beyonce"", ""A woman without makeup"") and an image encoded in the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN generator and predicts an offset vector that transforms the input image according to the text description of the edit.

"[Q] Best way to correct incorrect aggregated column figures in a time-series that closely resembles another  

Hi! This is the first question that I will ask, and so, I do apologize if I'm doing something incorrectly. I won't go into specifics because I don't want to break any rules.

At work, we ran into a problem back on February 19, 2020 where an aggregate column (series 1) was aggregating incorrectly due to some issues related to coding done by a third-party. Although that third-party is working on the solution, the solution will only apply from the date of implementation and can't make retroactive changes.

What is the best approach to ""correct"" these numbers if all we have is historical data from prior to February 19 and another series of data that's aggregated by a partner company? Prior to February 19, our numbers were usually 30%-40% of the partner's numbers.

The following link is a sample of the series 1(went wrong on February 19th) and series 2 (correct the entire time).

"People who are working in US on a visa, how has your experience been in terms of job search? Hello!

I am aware that a lot of people here are from US but I am guessing majority of the people are citizens. There have been posts about job search and its difficulties but not so much about how is it for people on a visa. Not sure if there are many people on this sub who are working in US on a visa but I wanted to try and know their experience.

I am on an F1 visa with 1 YOE and have been applying to jobs. But I have not been able to get any interviews besides Amazon (they reached out to me for a BI position, I never applied). Apart from that, I have been applying but haven't received any interview calls.

I was wondering is there something wrong with my resume, maybe 1 YOE is not enough or is it purely because not a lot of companies give sponsorship.

Would love to hear what your experience has been so far.

Thanks!",data science

"[NO SPOILERS] Has South Park revealed too much to me? Long explanation so please bare with me.


I’ve been on the fence about whether I want to watch Game of Thrones for a long time. But I absolutely can’t get into a series if I have had major details, plot points, or twists spoiled.A few years ago a friend accidentally spoiled a major death for me but another friend recently told me I should still be able to watch it, based on another detail I’d learned. Last night I watched the episode of South Park titled “Black Friday” and I’d realised it was heavily referencing Game of Thrones. I was okay with minor details being spilled and it was making Game of Thrones seem really interesting. But by the end of the episode I’d seen some references to some really big plot points. I haven’t watched the second South Park Game of Thrones episode yet though. Given what South Park referenced I’m sure I’ll be able to figure out which Game of Thrones characters were being parodied in South Park. So without giving further information on what South Park “spoiled” for me, can someone please tell me if they think I could still possibly get into the show? Or have I been given too much information to be able to get properly invested and enjoy the show to its full potential?",game of thrones
